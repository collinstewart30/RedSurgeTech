<p>When it comes to a contact page design, although you may not view this as important as other pages, it most certainly is. Fun fact, contact pages tend to get more views than most if not all other pages on a website. This is especially true for websites involving agencies or other services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The purpose of a contact page is, as probably assumed, to have a place for the user on the site to contact the site owner. I see so many sites just throw up a quick contact page and think nothing of it but this should not be the case. A well thought out and creative contact page design can make or break new customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top five tips I can give you on contact page design are as follows.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>1. Attention to Detail</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attention to detail is a very important thing when designing a contact page. Spelling and grammar are important when creating a contact page. Those small errors may be just enough to drive a potential client away due to the lack of attention to detail.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>2. Simplicity</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep everything about your contact page simple. From the design to actually figuring out how to contact the site owner, it should all be very simple and easy. Nobody wants to go through a extravagant scavenger hunt just to find out how to fill out a contact form. A nice sleek design with a simple contact form will do just fine in order to get the point across to the user.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>3. Appeal To Your Audience</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This one can be a bit tricky. You have to know your audience in order to appeal to them. For example, if you know you appeal to an older audience then keep it as simple as possible. In some cases, a contact form may not even be necessary. You can list out the email address and the phone number that you would like to be reached at and just leave it at that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>4. The Look</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The look of your contact page is very important. You obviously want it to correlate with the rest of your pages but also give it that unique contact page touch. Again, as said before the contact page is sometimes the most visited page on a website so you want to make sure it looks nice and fresh. An old clunky looking contact page design would not be a good choice when trying to gain more customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>5. Own Personal Touch/Inspiration</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your own personal touch is something you may end up doing to your contact page anyways. Users who reach your contact page are usually looking to learn about you and what it is you do. Show them. Give the page your own inspired design without getting too crazy. For example, <a href="https://basecamp.com/support">BaseCamp</a> has a fantastic contact page design. It is simple yet they give it their own touch for a warm welcoming feeling to the page.</p>
