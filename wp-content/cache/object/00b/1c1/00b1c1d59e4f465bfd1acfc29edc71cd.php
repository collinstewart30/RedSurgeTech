<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2021 WordPress.com <a href="https://poststatus.com/will-automattics-built-by-wordpress-compete-with-wordpress-freelancers/">announced</a> a premium $4,900 website building service ‚Äî builtbywp.com. It's still active but the <a href="https://builtbywp.com/#faq">FAQ</a> says, &#8220;Our website design & development services start at $3,500 USD.&#8221;</p>



<p>Now there's Built by WordPress.com <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/08/30/need-a-website-fast-let-us-do-it-for-you/">Express</a> ‚Äî where &#8220;in-house experts will build the site for you, all in four business days or less. The cost is $499, plus an additional purchase of the WordPress.com Premium plan.&#8221;</p>



<p>There's no way not to see this <a href="https://wordpress.com/do-it-for-me/">Do it for Me</a> service as competing with freelancers on the low end of the market, which <strong><a href="https://poststatus.com/will-automattics-built-by-wordpress-compete-with-wordpress-freelancers/">Matt Mullenweg</a></strong> previously <a href="https://poststatus.com/will-automattics-built-by-wordpress-compete-with-wordpress-freelancers/">claimed</a> was not the intention of the premium site building service last year. </p>



<p>He also estimated that <strong>Automattic</strong> captures less than 5% of the revenue in the total WordPress ecosystem ‚Äî much less than other large hosts. At the time, <strong>David Bisset</strong> writing for Post Status, asked for more transparency about &#8220;how many customers have been acquired and new sites built on WordPress.com.&#8221;</p>



<p>The WordPress market share has always been highest and expanded the most in the broadest market ‚Äî the top million active websites as measured by traffic. WordPress currently has around a 36% market share by that measure, but it falls to 14% in the top 10,000 most active sites. While sites with no (identifiable) CMS are still the largest and probably easiest area for growth, it's logical for WordPress.com to focus on the lower end of the market rather than leave it to other hosting companies. </p>



<p>Inevitably, freelancers are going to feel the squeeze as commodified websites and website building services compete downward on price. The wisdom usually offered about this is sound: learn the price points where you can be most competitive and trade on unique value you can bring to clients. </p>



<p>A geographically localized focus, an affinity-based or purpose-built niche of features, and personal referral networks are unique strengths. There are also plenty of important, high-budget clients whose websites never need or intend to serve millions of visitors. Built your own local or niche market analysis ‚Äî current market share data for WordPress doesn't tell you much. </p>



<p>A decade ago, <strong>Chris Butler</strong>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.newfangled.com/report-the-state-of-digital-marketing-for-small-a/">survey and report</a> at <strong>Newfangled</strong> for other small agencies was really helpful in <a href="https://www.newfangled.com/the-results-of-newfangleds-state-of-digital-marketing-for-small-agencies-survey/">getting the numbers that matter</a>. (I believe this survey was done more than once but not sustained over the years since then.) We could use something similar for WordPress agencies and freelancers. </p>

<h2>Teaching WordPress strengthens your understanding</h2>



<p>Bud has taught web design since 1998, with students from more than 80 countries online or in person. He was determined not to let his sight difficulties stop him from his wish to  help others learn website building and maintenance skills.   </p>



<p>As WordPress evolves and new features release, Bud decided to extend his training services around helping new and existing users improve and practice their skills. He supports others in open source through volunteering to speak at WordPress events, and encourages others to do so too. He also gives time to help produce material for the free-to-access resource <a href="https://learn.wordpress.org/">Learn WordPress,</a> which is part of the WordPress.org project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a contributor to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/">Test</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/training/">Training</a> teams, Bud is keen for others to try contributing to these areas and help support the project&#8217;s future development. One of his current training priorities is to help people with using the block editor and Full Site Editing. He is an advocate for the usability of WordPress today, saying: ‚ÄúI can design all aspects of a website now with a block.‚Äù</p>



<h2>Using WordPress as a traditional developer</h2>



<p>Bud‚Äôs WordPress journey began with a lunch at Grand Central Station in New York in 2009. A friend and former client was promoting the idea of using WordPress, which Bud initially resisted.</p>



<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm a code guy‚Ä¶,‚Äù he told his friend at the time. ‚ÄúI will never use anything like that.‚Äù</p>



<p>However, the friend persisted. Eventually, Bud gave it a try and found a new approach with things called themes and plugins. His first encounter was with <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/releases/">WordPress 2.6</a>. Bud signed up with a hosting company and found a theme where he could learn to edit and understand child themes.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Once I saw that you could edit anything and make it yours, I was hooked. The endorphins were freely coursing through my veins.&#8221; Bud was hooked.</p>



<h2>Teaching WordPress strengthens your own understanding of the software</h2>



<p>There‚Äôs an old saying that the best way to learn something new is to turn around and teach someone else.</p>



<p>Bud was already an instructor at the Fashion Institute of Technology when he thought, ‚ÄúI could teach WordPress!‚Äù</p>



<p>And so he did, packing classrooms all through those first years of WordPress as it swept through the design world and further.<br /><br />But Bud had more to discover. He said: &#8220;Two big things were about to happen that were really going to change my life. They would show me the way to the WordPress community ‚Äì not that I even knew what that was.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Sharing lessons learnt with the WordPress community</h2>



<p>In 2014, one of his students suggested he start going to the New York WordPress Meetup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As he started going to WordCamps in New York City, he realized that WordPress was getting very large. What‚Äôs more, it had a community of people with whom he felt at home and could learn alongside.</p>



<p>Bud gave a talk for the first time in 2016 at the only WordCamp to this day that has been held at the United Nations. He shared his knowledge of ‚ÄúLessons Learned: Considerations For Teaching Your Clients WordPress.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>



<img width="952" height="1024" src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=952%2C1024&ssl=1" alt="Bud Kraus talking at a WordCamp" class="wp-image-13340" /><em>Bud Kraus speaks at WordCamps to help people use the software even more effectively</em>



<p>From there, Bud went on to speak at other WordCamps in the US. He also volunteered as a speaker wrangler for his home camp in New York City in 2018 and 2019.</p>



<h2>From speaking to writing about WordPress</h2>



<p>At some point before the Covid-19 lockdown, Bud found another outlet, this time in writing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bud heard a magazine was advertising for submissions related to WordPress.&nbsp;His first attempted article did not make the cut.</p>



<p>So in his second submission, Bud took the risk of writing about something deeply personal ‚Äì a topic he really didn‚Äôt want to write about at all.</p>



<p>He gathered his courage and revealed to the entire web design world that he was legally blind.</p>



<p>The article appeared as&nbsp; <strong>‚Äú</strong><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/using-low-vision-teach-wordpress/"><strong>Using Low Vision As My Tool To Help Me Teach WordPress</strong></a><strong>‚Äù.</strong></p>



<img width="510" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=510%2C600&ssl=1" alt="Bud Kraus" class="wp-image-13426" />Bud Kraus



<p>Since the age of 37, Bud has had macular degeneration in both eyes, which affects his central vision. It is a leading cause of legal blindness in the United States and many other countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He relies on his peripheral vision and finding ways to compensate. He also tends to see things in a flat dimension and has a difficulty discerning contrast&nbsp; &#8211; he&nbsp; is glad there are starting to be improvements in color contrasts in web design!<br /><br />He uses tools like Speech to Text, larger sized cursors and bigger font sizes, and heavily uses zooming back in and out when working with WordPress. He is able to recognize patterns but has to rely on detailed preparation and memorizing materials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his first magazine article acknowledging this situation, he shared the added difficulties that technology creates for people with visual conditions, and tips that he had found to try and find alternative routes around them. He uses the technique of finding alternatives in his training work to help people learn and understand, realizing that all people have different ways of reading and understanding. His words and subsequent stories have inspired others and enabled more people to highlight accessibility. He describes himself as a ‚Äòstakeholder in ensuring that the WordPress admin is accessible.‚Äô</p>



<p>A year after its first publication, the piece became a WordCamp talk, ‚ÄòMy Way with WordPress.‚Äô The talk was a hit and started many conversations about accessibility and the importance of raising awareness.</p>



<p>A few months later, he gave a Gutenberg talk at the first WordCamp Montclair. There was no way he could have done it from a laptop, so instead, he did it from his 27‚Äù desktop computer. </p>



<p>Bud said: &#8220;It was a presentation on Gutenberg plugins. Since I couldn‚Äôt do this from a notebook screen (the screen is too small and the keyboard is hard for me to manipulate), it was decided that I would bring in my 27‚Ä≥ desktop machine to a WordCamp. I‚Äôm probably the first person to ever have done this. It was good thing I only lived a few miles away.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: ‚ÄúI sat behind my computer, did my thing, and every once in a while peered out to make sure people were still there.‚Äù</p>



<h2>Different ways of contributing to WordPress</h2>



<p>One of the main ways Bud supported the community around the software was through talks at WordCamps and helping others to speak. </p>



<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, he was keen to continue contributing when WordCamps were no longer meeting in person. He turned greater attention to supporting the <a href="https://learn.wordpress.org/">Learn WordPress</a> resource, a free to use learning platform made by and for the community itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More training materials on the block editor can be found on Learn WordPress and his WordCamp talks are available on <a href="https://wordpress.tv/?s=kraus&speakers=bud-kraus">WordPress.tv</a>.</p>

<p>Bud‚Äôs training materials and willingness to talk about accessibility have helped so many people find their way with WordPress. He in turn is an advocate for the community around open source.</p>



<p>He said: ‚ÄúThe software is really good, and the people are even better.‚Äù &nbsp;</p>



<p>He added: ‚ÄúI get a sense of accomplishment whenever I launch a new or redesigned site. It‚Äôs also given me a great feeling to know that many people have learned WordPress around the world from my <a href="https://wordpress.tv/?s=kraus&speakers=bud-kraus">talks and presentations</a>. This might just be the most gratifying thing of all.‚Äù</p>

Transcript<div>
<p>[00:00:00] Nathan Wrigley: Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>



<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case how WordPress can be the backbone of a profitable newsletter.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>



<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to share on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you all your idea featured on the show. Head over to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the contact form there.</p>



<p>So on the podcast today, we have Laura Nelson.</p>



<p>Laura is a content marketer at WooCommerce, where she&#8217;s responsible for creating and planning engaging content for their users. Prior to WooCommerce she worked at MailPoet, an email marketing plugin for WordPress, and before that she worked at Pragmatic, a UK based WordPress agency.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s on the show to explore her experience of how you can, and while you might want to set up a paid email newsletter.</p>



<p>When I hear the word newsletter, I&#8217;m typically thinking about the information which drops into your inbox on a daily basis. We&#8217;ve all surrendered our email addresses in return for some product or service. We agree to receive emails on the understanding that we can unsubscribe at some point.</p>



<p>Perhaps a few of these emails really resonate with you, but it&#8217;s likely that you unsubscribed from many as the content was no longer wanted. This kind of email marketing is not always viewed favorably, and it&#8217;s not the kind of technique that Laura is talking about on the podcast today. Her pitch is that email newsletters can themselves be a product? That people will pay to receive your emails, and she&#8217;s got data and examples to back it up.</p>



<p>I suppose that the closest analogy would be people who create an online course. You have an area of expertise. You do the hard work of creating the course and people will pay for a membership to have the benefit of learning from your expertise.</p>



<p>Laura is describing something similar to that. The only difference being that instead of a course, people will pay to receive your emails, knowing that you&#8217;re going to bring value to them regularly. I know that this can be done because as you will hear, I&#8217;m a ,subscriber to some of the emails which Laura mentioned.</p>



<p>This is not a get rich quick scheme. It&#8217;s hard work and you&#8217;ve got to cultivate your audience and give them something of value, repeatedly.</p>



<p>Typically when we record the podcast, there&#8217;s not a lot of background noise, but that&#8217;s not always the case with these WordCamp Europe interviews. We were competing against crowds and the air conditioning. And whilst the podcasts are more than listenable, I hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world were a play.</p>



<p>One last thing to mention is that I&#8217;ll be attending WordCamp US next week. And as a result there won&#8217;t be a podcast episode. If you&#8217;re going to be there. I do hope that our paths cross.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more about the podcast, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. And you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes of there as well.</p>



<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Laura Nelson.</p>



<p>I am joined on the podcast by Laura Nelson. Hello.</p>



<p>[00:04:19] Laura Nelson: Hello.</p>



<p>[00:04:20] Nathan Wrigley: Laura did a talk yesterday?</p>



<p>[00:04:23] Laura Nelson: Yesterday afternoon. Yep. So I&#8217;m feeling pretty good today.</p>



<p>[00:04:27] Nathan Wrigley: You&#8217;re feeling happy. Yeah, she did a talk at WordCamp Europe, 2022. What was it entitled? What was it about?</p>



<p>[00:04:32] Laura Nelson: It was how to create a paid newsletter subscription in WordPress.</p>



<p>[00:04:35] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, and did it go well?</p>



<p>[00:04:38] Laura Nelson: I think so.</p>



<p>[00:04:39] Nathan Wrigley: So we&#8217;re gonna be talking today about newsletters. Obviously newsletters, they do seem to be all the rage.</p>



<p>[00:04:45] Laura Nelson: Yeah, every so often you hear like, email is dead, it&#8217;s all about TikTok and in fairness it is all about TikTok at the moment. But email marketing is amazing way to speak to your customers or your audience.</p>



<p>[00:04:57] Nathan Wrigley: Does the data back that up then? Reliably over the last 20 years, we can say email still works?</p>



<p>[00:05:02] Laura Nelson: Yeah, yeah. And conversion rates are far higher from email marketing than they are from like, if you tweet about your product or your services. Email marketing is golden in terms of conversion rates.</p>



<p>[00:05:13] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s interesting. Just the interface is a little bit more, how to describe it? TikTok&#8217;s a bit more ephemeral. There&#8217;s a lot going on, and there&#8217;s a lot making you wish to scroll past all of the things. I think it&#8217;s the only thing that&#8217;s been with me for 20 years.</p>



<p>[00:05:26] Laura Nelson: Exactly. People are familiar with it. They know how it works, they know what to expect from an email. I think you&#8217;re capturing people at a good time, because generally they&#8217;re not gonna open their emails unless they have time to read your email. Whereas if you are like on Twitter and you&#8217;re like idly scrolling or you&#8217;ve got like two minutes, it forces them to stop, but they might not have time to take that information in. So email, it&#8217;s nice. It sits there. If you don&#8217;t have time to read it properly when you first open it, you can come back to it.</p>



<p>[00:05:53] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that&#8217;s a good point. I was just thinking about that. And if I don&#8217;t log into Twitter for a few days, there&#8217;s almost no chance that I&#8217;m gonna see the things from three days ago, because I&#8217;m gonna start at the top. Yeah, that&#8217;s a really good point.</p>



<p>So, when you&#8217;re talking about newsletters, presumably we&#8217;re talking about a piece where people have subscribed to a newsletter, and you are then offering content to them. Is that basically the model?</p>



<p>[00:06:16] Laura Nelson: That&#8217;s right, yeah.</p>



<p>[00:06:17] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, and you are talking about getting paid and generating revenue, and it almost sounds like it&#8217;s too good to be true. You throw together a newsletter and suddenly, you become incredibly wealthy. Of course that&#8217;s not the case. There&#8217;s probably a lot of hard work. There&#8217;s probably a lot of expertise required. Is that true?</p>



<p>[00:06:33] Laura Nelson: Yes. I&#8217;d say the hardest part of this is building your list. So if you don&#8217;t already have people in your community or your audience available, you probably have to put a bit more effort into marketing. But in terms of expertise, you can write a newsletter about anything you want.</p>



<p>The example I gave in my talk yesterday was a newsletter about cats, and that&#8217;s an interest. I&#8217;m not an expert on cats, I just think cats are cute. And so, you can use them in whatever ways you want. I definitely don&#8217;t think you have to be an expert in a specific subject. If you are good at writing, or if you have interesting or unusual opinions about things, you can easily make an email newsletter.</p>



<p>[00:07:11] Nathan Wrigley: Before we pressed record, we talked about the fact that there is a rival platform, which I think by now probably most people have heard of. It&#8217;s called Substack. And you likened what you were describing in the talk and probably what we&#8217;re gonna be talking about as a, kind of an alternative to that.</p>



<p>[00:07:26] Laura Nelson: Yes. That&#8217;s right. Substack is huge now, and I can&#8217;t remember the figures off the top of my head, but there are millions of subscribers across all the Substack newsletters, I guess you&#8217;d call them. And the solution that I&#8217;m gonna be talking to you about is an alternative to keep that in WordPress, rather than outsourcing that to a different platform.</p>



<p>[00:07:46] Nathan Wrigley: Is there a strong reason in your head why you would not wish to go with the, it&#8217;s the SaaS versus WordPress argument. You could have this about a thousand different SaaS platforms. But is there a strong reason in your head why you wish to do it in WordPress and not just pay Substack the fee and get on with it over there?</p>



<p>[00:08:00] Laura Nelson: I think WordPress, I mean, WordPress lends itself to content. Like WordPress is where you publish content. And we&#8217;re talking about sharing content in a newsletter. And I think like this method, what most appeals about it to me is the fact that everything is in one place, and it&#8217;s familiar.</p>



<p>So if you already have a WordPress website or a business that&#8217;s using WordPress to power it then you don&#8217;t have to learn something new, it&#8217;s already, it&#8217;s just there. It can be extended onto what you are already doing.</p>



<p>[00:08:27] Nathan Wrigley: The payment bit, we&#8217;ll probably unpick the payment puzzle, but is this basically a paywall thing? In other words, are you restricting content? Are you only sending out to people who&#8217;ve paid? Or is it that you embed other things inside the newsletters, you know, upsells and subscriptions that people might join and so on?</p>



<p>[00:08:44] Laura Nelson: No, no, you are only sending the content to those who&#8217;ve paid. So it&#8217;s like a subscription, like you would, sign up to like a, I think you can get them for like dog and cat food, where they get delivered regularly. Then you, yeah, just like that. But instead you&#8217;re receiving content in your inbox.</p>



<p>[00:08:58] Nathan Wrigley: So you are going to describe to us a system built where you go to the website, you&#8217;re engaged, you sign up, you begin receiving emails and if your subscription payment is cancelled, the emails fail, and it stops.</p>



<p>[00:09:09] Laura Nelson: Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly it.</p>



<p>[00:09:11] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so what plugins are you using?</p>



<p>[00:09:13] Laura Nelson: Yeah, so in addition to like being on a WordPress website, so disclaimer, I mean, if you&#8217;re not on WordPress, I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re listening to this.</p>



<p>[00:09:19] Nathan Wrigley: No, that&#8217;s probably fair.</p>



<p>[00:09:21] Laura Nelson: You&#8217;ll need like WooCommerce, MailPoet, which is an email marketing plugin for WordPress, and WooCommerce subscriptions.</p>



<p>[00:09:28] Nathan Wrigley: So the basic WooCommerce to sort of bind the whole subscription thing together. You add the subscription thing on top. And then there&#8217;s MailPoet. Is there any cost to any of that?</p>



<p>[00:09:36] Laura Nelson: Yeah, so WooCommerce subscriptions is $199 per year. MailPoet is free to use up to a thousand subscribers. So when you get beyond that, there&#8217;s tiered plans. But I think the lowest plan starts at around $12 or $15 per month. It&#8217;s quite reasonable.</p>



<p>[00:09:53] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;ve heard, and I don&#8217;t know where this number comes from, but I&#8217;ve heard that if your email list is a thousand people, roughly you can become profitable. And what I mean by that is that you can become profitable enough for it to become an important part of what you do. And it always felt that that was like a really, quite a low number.</p>



<p>But then having tried to create email lists in the past, I quickly realized actually a thousand is pretty hard to get to. It&#8217;s difficult to get people to surrender their email address. So is there any advice that you give to people essentially to give you their email address?</p>



<p>[00:10:25] Laura Nelson: Yeah. I think what works best is honesty. Be upfront and honest about what you&#8217;re gonna be sending to them. That you&#8217;re not gonna pass on your, their email to somebody else. And when you&#8217;re going to, like the frequency that they can expect to receive emails from you.</p>



<p>And then it&#8217;s just a case of making sure that the content that you&#8217;re including in it is really valuable, offers something a bit different or unique that they might not be able to read elsewhere. I mean, that&#8217;s like solid advice for if it&#8217;s a paid newsletter or not paid. And then it&#8217;s just another form of marketing.</p>



<p>So I recommend including, including a link to sign up in all of your normal email signatures, like from your Gmail or whatever you use. Use your social networks. If you have a good community on Twitter, let them know about your newsletter. Basically, plug it everywhere that you possibly can.</p>



<p>[00:11:13] Nathan Wrigley: Does the MailPoet solution, does it allow you to create, so forgive me, first of all, I&#8217;ve not used MailPoet, so I don&#8217;t know how the UI works, but does it allow you to basically create a post in WordPress, which is then fired out as an email?</p>



<p>[00:11:25] Laura Nelson: Yes and no. So if you mean like a post in WordPress that you&#8217;d be able to go onto a WordPress website and see it in like the blog section. It wouldn&#8217;t work that way around. If you had published a blog post on WordPress and then use MailPoet to send an email, it&#8217;s a tick, like a widget, that you drag in and a tick that and you can include that entire blog post in your email.</p>



<p>[00:11:45] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So you create a normal blog post. Tick a box. When you click publish, it is converted to an email and sent out?</p>



<p>[00:11:52] Laura Nelson: Yeah. Or you drag it into like your email template, and you can add other stuff around it.</p>



<p>[00:11:56] Nathan Wrigley: Oh, okay. So you could put a different header and a different footer in? Okay.</p>



<p>[00:11:59] Laura Nelson: And in the case of the paid news letter though, you&#8217;d probably, in order to get people to sign up and pay for this, you don&#8217;t want that content being available on your website for free. So you&#8217;d probably want to write the post within the email itself. So it only lives there and not elsewhere.</p>



<p>[00:12:16] Nathan Wrigley: Yes, that wouldn&#8217;t make sense, would it? If it was a paid newsletter, and the content was available on your website.</p>



<p>[00:12:21] Laura Nelson: But you could use WooCommerce memberships. You could guard that and make it a private post and then link to it it.</p>



<p>[00:12:27] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So as with all things WordPress, there&#8217;s a way.</p>



<p>[00:12:30] Laura Nelson: Yeah. You can add another layer to this if you want to do that.</p>



<p>[00:12:32] Nathan Wrigley: If somebody was to begin a completely new website. You know, they wanna talk about, I dunno, volcanoes or something. Then would you be able to do this on pretty modest hosting? Because it doesn&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s a lot going on. Basic WordPress, basic WooCommerce, a couple of extra plugins, maybe really cheap hosting?</p>



<p>[00:12:50] Laura Nelson: Uh, yeah. Really, unless you are planning on adding loads of other products to your store or adding loads and loads of other content to your website. You can keep this really lean and get away with really cheap posting. It wouldn&#8217;t take much, you just need a product page really.</p>



<p>[00:13:05] Nathan Wrigley: The difficulty I think maybe is trying to get people to find your newsletter in the first place. And then of course there&#8217;s the problem of getting them to separate their email and give it to you. Have you got any advice for how you market your newsletter? Anything around there?</p>



<p>[00:13:21] Laura Nelson: Yeah. It&#8217;s funny. Someone asked me this yesterday after the talk and I, I said I could probably do an entire other presentation on this exact topic.</p>



<p>[00:13:30] Nathan Wrigley: Go deep, it&#8217;s good.</p>



<p>[00:13:31] Laura Nelson: So, what I was saying earlier about being really upfront about what you&#8217;re gonna be sending, when you&#8217;re gonna be sending it. Know what you&#8217;re doing with their email address. And you just really need to show some value. So you need to make sure that the content that you are creating is unique or if you do have an expertise in a certain area, really let people know, like why that&#8217;s important to them.</p>



<p>Content is all about problem solving for people. So you need to find out what problems people have. And if you can solve that in content, then let them know.</p>



<p>[00:14:03] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m guessing that some things are going to be more of a labour of love than other things. Again if you&#8217;re producing the volcano newsletter, I&#8217;m expecting in the low single digits.</p>



<p>[00:14:12] Laura Nelson: Well you know, it&#8217;s a niche market I imagine. Maybe that would be more successful because you know, you get people who are really into something like that. You know, there&#8217;s probably not a lot. I dunno, I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m not familiar with the volcano market. I&#8217;m not gonna lie, but, um, I kind of imagine there will be those niche areas like that, where if there&#8217;s not content being published about that or at least readily available to you, then you probably would pay. It&#8217;s like, oh yeah, I love that, and I&#8217;m really interested in that. So I would pay to receive.</p>



<p>[00:14:40] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting because of course you&#8217;ve gotta think about the person reading the content and whether volcanoes are gonna be of any interest to them, but also your ability to sustain this, is directly related to how interested you think it is.</p>



<p>So, you know, if you genuinely have no interest in volcanoes and you embark on that mission, probably it&#8217;s gonna dry up fairly quickly, and so I wonder if often people in this chase the big thing, the big shiny, exciting thing only to discover, you know, what, actually on a deep, personal level, I&#8217;m not interested in this, and the newsletter dries up and falters and fails.</p>



<p>[00:15:16] Laura Nelson: If you&#8217;re thinking about starting this up, you need to remember, it&#8217;s not just one email. It&#8217;s not just two. It has to have like longevity to it. So whatever it is, whatever topic you&#8217;re choosing, obviously you can&#8217;t possibly know what you might like to talk about or write about in six months time, but you need to make sure that the topic is either big enough or is like new things are happening in that area enough in order to sustain a long term newsletter.</p>



<p>[00:15:42] Nathan Wrigley: I wonder if this is like a perfect extension to people who are already doing things. They might have got a YouTube channel. They might have a WordPress website and they&#8217;re producing things. Or in this case here we are on a podcast. It may be that you&#8217;ve got that kind of thing. It feels like a bit of a no brainer to just add this on as a kind of value add. So you could have, well, I don&#8217;t know, content that only subscribers get, or things like that. Is that where the market seems to be leading.</p>



<p>[00:16:08] Laura Nelson: Absolutely. You obviously can start from scratch and it, technically it&#8217;s pretty easy to do so, in that respect. But, you&#8217;re gonna have more success if you already have, you need to make sure you already have an audience. And if you already have a business, you already have a customer base or an audience that are, are listening to you, and you&#8217;re communicating with. So yeah, I think it&#8217;s an obvious, like an easy fit for established businesses.</p>



<p>[00:16:34] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. So if you&#8217;ve got something going already. It&#8217;s almost like a missing piece of the jigsaw if you&#8217;re not doing it.</p>



<p>[00:16:39] Laura Nelson: It&#8217;s not to be used to like plug your products or services. It&#8217;s not like, I guess if you were to run a, an eCommerce store and you sell products, it&#8217;s not to be used like that. It&#8217;s like a highlight of, oh, we got these new trainers in stock etc. You have to be adding something of value, like an opinion or some content that they can&#8217;t get elsewhere. I think one of the, um, examples I gave yesterday was digital downloads. Like if you&#8217;re really good photographer, you could share your photos in an email newsletter and let have access to use your photos, you know? Like on a weekly basis like, 10 new photos every week or fortnight or something.</p>



<p>[00:17:18] Nathan Wrigley: So this is subscription, which means we must decide on a subscription term. Do you typically, would you say like go monthly? Is that, is that the easiest, least friction way to do it? Sort of asking people to separate money from their wallet, monthly, annually.</p>



<p>[00:17:34] Laura Nelson: I&#8217;d offer both a monthly option and then a yearly, maybe it would just slightly discounted. Because it&#8217;s great. If you have people signed up for a year or they&#8217;ve committed to that year, that&#8217;s excellent. But I&#8217;d always give people the option of monthly.</p>



<p>[00:17:45] Nathan Wrigley: My fear of offering an annual plan would be that I just dry up. You know, I&#8217;d be eight months in and I&#8217;d be, ah, I&#8217;ve got nothing else to say, and then I&#8217;ve got to think about the, the sort of refund process.</p>



<p>[00:17:58] Laura Nelson: Yeah. If you do that, you would probably have to refund people, but offering a yearly option is something you could consider after you&#8217;ve got into the groove of creating a newsletter and you think you can see it has a longer life to it.</p>



<p>[00:18:10] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah I know this, what we&#8217;ve been talking about is a WordPress thing. The piece that you described, the MailPoet and the WooCommerce bit is the way to get paid for that. Just briefly talking about alternative ways of doing that. The sponsorship bit, or the payment bit outside of WordPress. There&#8217;s things like Patreon and Ko-fi is that, an angle you&#8217;ve ever looked at or explored?</p>



<p>[00:18:30] Laura Nelson: Yeah, and like Substack. They&#8217;re all like really great platforms to use. But they&#8217;re outside of WordPress. So, I think the kind of unique angle here or for this approach is, if you want everything to be all in one place, if you&#8217;re already creating content in WordPress, don&#8217;t spend your time copying and pacing it over to a different piece of software. You can have it all like in one dashboard, basically. Ownership is a big part of that.</p>



<p>[00:18:59] Nathan Wrigley: Thorny question.</p>



<p>[00:19:01] Laura Nelson: Mm-hmm.</p>



<p>[00:19:01] Nathan Wrigley: Where are the email addresses stored?</p>



<p>[00:19:03] Laura Nelson: Right? So in MailPoet, no one else can see your subscriber&#8217;s email addresses. MailPoet takes, email best practices and security very seriously. We don&#8217;t even see the emails that get sent out via MailPoet. So they&#8217;re stored on, I think it&#8217;s like your server, they belong with you.</p>



<p>[00:19:22] Nathan Wrigley: Mm-hmm.</p>



<p>[00:19:23] Laura Nelson: They don&#8217;t come to MailPoet at any point. They are yours.</p>



<p>[00:19:26] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s an interesting thing. And I guess you would need to be mindful of GDPR if you are storing people&#8217;s email addresses. Do you have any insight into whether those are in the database? Do you know whether they&#8217;re in an encrypted, in an encrypted form or not?</p>



<p>[00:19:40] Laura Nelson: This is a technical question that I am not able to answer, I&#8217;m afraid. At least not confidently. I think I know the answer, but I absolutely wouldn&#8217;t want to go on a podcast and tell everybody the wrong thing if that&#8217;s okay.</p>



<p>[00:19:51] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s okay we could could look at that another time. And so have you got any good examples of newsletters where you could say, go and have a look at that one. Two or three that you think are really worthwhile where somebody&#8217;s done it just right. They&#8217;re doing really well.</p>



<p>[00:20:03] Laura Nelson: So the first one&#8217;s called Dense Discovery. None of these examples are actually of paid, well, actually I can give some paid newsletter examples. Let me start with Dense Discovery, which you can pay for, but they handle the payment a slightly different way. It&#8217;s more like a tip based system. Like if you enjoy this, you know, become a friend of the newsletter. But from a content perspective, I would pay to receive Dense Discovery.</p>



<p>If they offered it up as a subscription, I would do that. Cause I tip on a regular basis. It has a really good balance of the guy who&#8217;s created the newsletter called Kai, like his opinion, and his take on what&#8217;s happening in the world. There are some lovely resources for like design. He often shares like an illustrator and their work, as well as some like handy tools for like productivity at work.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s kind like a nice, a nice blend of content. And it&#8217;s really regular. I know when I&#8217;m gonna receive it. It&#8217;s the same time each week, and I know the quality of the content&#8217;s gonna be really, really good.</p>



<p>[00:21:01] Nathan Wrigley: Can I just pause you there, and just go on a bit of a segue and we&#8217;ll come back to some other ones in a minute, because that just suddenly occurred to me. There&#8217;s something a bit meta going on there, because he&#8217;s not asking for a subscription, but what if you had an email newsletter, which was a, the sort of upsell for the paid newsletter?</p>



<p>[00:21:17] Laura Nelson: Oh yeah.</p>



<p>[00:21:18] Nathan Wrigley: If you know what I mean? So the newsletter itself contains a proportion of the content. Is that a thing?</p>



<p>[00:21:24] Laura Nelson: Yeah, absolutely. And actually the next example I was going to give. I&#8217;d like to like add to disclaimer it, this isn&#8217;t of my interest but&#8217;s I can see it&#8217;s done really, really well, which is why I&#8217;m gonna mention it. It&#8217;s called Daily Coding Problem. So it uses this paid newsletter technique really interestingly. It&#8217;s basically they send like a coding problem. It&#8217;s designed to help programmers prepare for technical interviews. And if you are only a free subscriber, you don&#8217;t get to see the answer.</p>



<p>[00:21:53] Nathan Wrigley: Oh.</p>



<p>[00:21:53] Laura Nelson: Uhhuh.</p>



<p>[00:21:54] Nathan Wrigley: That is intriguing. Yeah, that&#8217;s kind of like using the annoyance style isn&#8217;t it? Yeah.</p>



<p>[00:21:58] Laura Nelson: So I mean, if you&#8217;re really confident with these, maybe you don&#8217;t, maybe you don&#8217;t need to see them, like the mystery. Yeah, you have to become a paid subscriber to see the solution.</p>



<p>[00:22:07] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s fascinating. So throw something out there. It&#8217;s a bit like if Wordle didn&#8217;t give you the answer.</p>



<p>[00:22:12] Laura Nelson: I know. How annoying would that be?</p>



<p>[00:22:14] Nathan Wrigley: Well, you&#8217;d pay.</p>



<p>[00:22:16] Laura Nelson: Exactly.</p>



<p>[00:22:17] Nathan Wrigley: And you&#8217;d get the answer every, every day. Yeah, that&#8217;s fascinating. So I mean that&#8217;s really unique isn&#8217;t it? But presumably most of it is about just the kind of stuff that you would ordinarily put on your website. You just make sure that the content&#8217;s really good, but you indicate they&#8217;ve got to the end of this newsletter, but there&#8217;s more.</p>



<p>[00:22:32] Laura Nelson: Yeah, yeah.</p>



<p>[00:22:32] Nathan Wrigley: You could find out more.</p>



<p>[00:22:33] Laura Nelson: Absolutely. And another example, um, which I mentioned yesterday actually was Jack&#8217;s Flight Club.</p>



<p>[00:22:38] Nathan Wrigley: Oh. I pay for Jack&#8217;s Flight Club.</p>



<p>[00:22:40] Laura Nelson: You&#8217;re newsletter subscriber.</p>



<p>[00:22:42] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s fascinating. I hadn&#8217;t connected. I use the app.</p>



<p>[00:22:46] Laura Nelson: Yeah.</p>



<p>[00:22:47] Nathan Wrigley: But it is a newsletter, is and he got me through the newsletter. You&#8217;re right. Go on, tell them about Jack&#8217;s Flight Club.</p>



<p>[00:22:52] Laura Nelson: Yeah, so Jack&#8217;s Flight Club, as we just heard, is, it&#8217;s a really popular one, uh, in the UK and Europe. And it sends you like error fairs and cheap flight deals. But if you&#8217;re not a paid subscriber, you don&#8217;t get all of the deals. And when you get the free version of email, they tell you which deals that you missed. So it really plays on that, like FOMO, like, you know, you&#8217;ve missed these incredibly cheap flights to Canada. You didn&#8217;t get that because you&#8217;re not a paid subscriber.</p>



<p>[00:23:18] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s right. And the interesting thing about that one is. That&#8217;s kind of opened my eyes up actually about where the price points may be. And maybe, maybe Jack is different, but it&#8217;s about if I recall, I think I paid about $40, something like that per year. So it was not really a lot. If you spread that over the, you know, it&#8217;s like $3 80 or a month</p>



<p>[00:23:40] Laura Nelson: Yep.</p>



<p>[00:23:40] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s really not a significant amount, but presumably if Jack, I&#8217;m guessing there is a Jack, I don&#8217;t know, but presumably if Jack&#8217;s into the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. This</p>



<p>is incredible‚Ä¶ a million.</p>



<p>[00:23:52] Laura Nelson: He&#8217;s got a million subscribers, million plus, yeah.</p>



<p>[00:23:55] Nathan Wrigley: We can work the maths out there. Okay Jack&#8217;s doing well from newsletters.</p>



<p>[00:23:58] Laura Nelson: Jack&#8217;s doing alright. Well, it&#8217;s the success of a newsletter that enabled him to take it to an app and, you know, grow this beyond just email content.</p>



<p>[00:24:06] Nathan Wrigley: I want to be Jack.</p>



<p>[00:24:08] Laura Nelson: Yeah, me too. I bet he&#8217;s on a yacht somewhere lovely, right. He&#8217;s not looking up cheap flights.</p>



<p>[00:24:12] Nathan Wrigley: He&#8217;s no longer looking, but that really illustrates it perfectly. So it was something most people probably don&#8217;t care about flights at all. They&#8217;ll just look the flight when they&#8217;re going on holiday but here&#8217;s me, I&#8217;m intrigued. I want if there is a cheap deal out there. So it&#8217;s got me on that niche thing. Like the coding chap.</p>



<p>And, I don&#8217;t know how long it took me. I think he was probably giving me the free one for six months.</p>



<p>[00:24:35] Laura Nelson: Yep.</p>



<p>[00:24:36] Nathan Wrigley: Do you know what he also did, which was curious, which was actually the hook. He offered a 20% discount in one of his emails. So that&#8217;s another interesting pricing strategy. He had his annual price and then he, for a week only, I think it was 20% off. That was the, the fishing rod that I happily bit on. And, and I think he&#8217;s got me for years to come.</p>



<p>[00:24:56] Laura Nelson: Yeah. You can do that with this, and I&#8217;d recommend exploring things like that. Just jumping back to your question earlier about how to get paid subscribers. If you already run a successful newsletter, you can drop in the bit about you having a paid newsletter too, give &#8217;em a little taster of what they&#8217;ve missed or what they will miss if they don&#8217;t pay to subscribe and yeah, it got you.</p>



<p>[00:25:17] Nathan Wrigley: It works. And interestingly enough, I am pretty difficult to get, and yet he got me. So it is, it is about the niche I think.</p>



<p>[00:25:25] Laura Nelson: Yeah, yeah.</p>



<p>[00:25:25] Nathan Wrigley: Well, let&#8217;s talk about the actual email itself. So we open up the email. Are there any sort of top tips about the way you should present things? I mean, are we looking for bright and colorful? Are we looking for more words than images? Are there trip wires that prevent the email clients from opening things? Because there&#8217;s just way too much text and it truncates it. Just give us what the email actually should be looking like.</p>



<p>[00:25:47] Laura Nelson: Well, I mean, it does completely depend, like what you&#8217;re including in it. I wouldn&#8217;t be, if you are selling a like long form content style email, don&#8217;t be afraid of including lots of words. Because that&#8217;s what people are paying for. But in terms of spam filters, if you&#8217;re offering a paid newsletter subscription, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d have any issues because it&#8217;s usually things like the word free and like capital letters, lots of exclamation marks.</p>



<p>[00:26:09] Nathan Wrigley: Emojis in the subject line, yeah.</p>



<p>[00:26:12] Laura Nelson: Emojis in the subject line are okay, as long as they&#8217;re not overused. Yeah. Basically emails like don&#8217;t overdo anything.</p>



<p>[00:26:20] Nathan Wrigley: Okay.</p>



<p>[00:26:21] Laura Nelson: A good, combination of yeah, different things that works well. In terms of layout, I mean, just take a step back and think about what you&#8217;d like to read. If it&#8217;s a big wall of text, would that entice you to read it? I mean, some people maybe, but not no. So, and you can format the newsletter to look how you want. So you could add spaces, you can add some images, you can use columns if that&#8217;s better for your content, so.</p>



<p>[00:26:45] Nathan Wrigley: The last time I was fiddling with email, I think we&#8217;re still stuck in tables. Are there big constraints still about the way that you can present things? So obviously on the web, our own WordPress websites, we can literally put anything anywhere, pixel by pixel, more or less. Are we confined with emails still? I mean are we still thinking about email clients from the year 2004 as a thing?</p>



<p>[00:27:06] Laura Nelson: Yeah. Well, I mean email&#8217;s tricky because it will look different according to different email clients, and Outlook is forever a bug bear for those who create emails. But if you&#8217;re using email marketing software, I mean, I can only speak to MailPoet, and I&#8217;m not just trying to plug here. It&#8217;s just the one I&#8217;m most familiar with. Their templates are already fully responsive. Their templates are tested on all the different email clients. So you can kind of be pretty confident that unless you&#8217;ve gone in and really messed with that, they&#8217;re gonna work in most email clients.</p>



<p>Litmus is a great tool if you&#8217;re not sure. Email on Acid to test your emails, to see what they&#8217;re going to look like on Outlook, on Gmail, all the big email.</p>



<p>[00:27:47] Nathan Wrigley: And how do they work? You send Email on Acid an actual email and it then tells you, it gives you a rating or things to improve and so on.</p>



<p>[00:27:54] Laura Nelson: It will show you how they look across the different email clients.</p>



<p>[00:27:58] Nathan Wrigley: Tell us about the actual UI, about how you build email. I&#8217;ve logged into all sorts of services. Typically there&#8217;s a bunch of modules for want of a better word, a bit like in Gutenberg with blocks now. So you drag in a, an image and you could drag in a couple of columns and put the image to the left, and text to the right. Is it what you see is what you get kind of builder?</p>



<p>[00:28:18] Laura Nelson: Yeah. Yeah. It is a WYSIWYG builder. It doesn&#8217;t use Gutenberg but I know the MailPoet team are looking to explore that option. But the email itself is a WYSIWYG editor where you drag and drop.</p>



<p>[00:28:30] Nathan Wrigley: So it&#8217;s familiar? You&#8217;ll be right at home. Yeah.</p>



<p>[00:28:32] Laura Nelson: I don&#8217;t like describing things as easy because I think different people have different perceptions of what&#8217;s easy, but this is the easiest email editor I&#8217;ve ever used, because it is simply you drag it and you drop it where you want it.</p>



<p>[00:28:46] Nathan Wrigley: Do you get an opportunity to inspect it before you commit?</p>



<p>[00:28:51] Laura Nelson: Yeah.</p>



<p>[00:28:51] Nathan Wrigley: So it will send you a version you can inspect make sure the links are all working and so on.</p>



<p>[00:28:56] Laura Nelson: Yeah, absolutely.</p>



<p>[00:28:18] Nathan Wrigley: And does it check that stuff as well? So in other words, it will see that for example, you&#8217;ve overused images, Nathan. Stop with the images volcanoes. Or that there&#8217;s too much text typically. Does it give you any metrics about, what is that called even? Because I&#8217;ve seen that before, they do some sort of test in the background and give you a rating.</p>



<p>[00:29:14] Laura Nelson: Like a readability.</p>



<p>[00:29:15] Nathan Wrigley: Something along those lines, yeah.</p>



<p>[00:29:17] Laura Nelson: It doesn&#8217;t, no. I think because the way MailPoet&#8217;s built and we don&#8217;t see your email content.</p>



<p>[00:29:23] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s interesting because it&#8217;s your WordPress site. So it&#8217;s your email. So it&#8217;s not phoning home any to any third parties.</p>



<p>[00:29:29] Laura Nelson: It&#8217;s not but that&#8217;s a pretty interesting idea. Maybe I&#8217;ll pass it onto the team.</p>



<p>[00:29:32] Nathan Wrigley: Oh okay.</p>



<p>[00:29:33] Laura Nelson: That would be useful.</p>



<p>[00:29:34] Nathan Wrigley: Can I take credit for that?</p>



<p>[00:29:35] Laura Nelson: The feature will be called email read, readability by Nathan.</p>



<p>[00:29:40] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s great. Okay I&#8217;m happy with that. So Laura, just before we wrap up, where&#8217;s the best place to find out about, well, in this case, MailPoet, where do we go?</p>



<p>[00:29:48] Laura Nelson: MailPoet.com. If you head to the blog, there&#8217;s some really great articles there about email marketing in general. How to build your list. There&#8217;s even a blog post about creating a paid newsletter. Like what my talk was on yesterday. Fantastic resource for all things email marketing.</p>



<p>[00:30:04] Nathan Wrigley: Well Laura, well done for getting through your talk at WordCamp Europe.</p>



<p>[00:30:07] Laura Nelson: Thank you. Thank you.</p>



<p>[00:30:08] Nathan Wrigley: A nice relief and, very happy to have you on the podcast today.</p>



<p>[00:30:12] Laura Nelson: Thank you so much for having me. It&#8217;s been a pleasure.</p>

Varghese is founder of FlyingProxy, a competing company, and identifies himself as a &#8220;performance enthusiast.&#8221; He accused the plugin of &#8220;cheating Pagespeed and other tools&#8221; by hiding JavaScript files from loading when users test their sites through popular performance testing tools. The code uses an odd set of obfuscated names for the testing tools, which drew his suspicion. </p>



<p>Varghese neglected to mention in his <a href="https://twitter.com/GijoVarghese_/status/1563097754322501632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1563097754322501632%7Ctwgr%5Ebf97b211fb13920391541b64137000b5ea1edc0c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwptavern.com%2Fwp-optimize-plugin-accused-of-cheating-pagespeed-and-other-performance-testing-tools">tweet</a> that this is what happens when one of the plugin&#8217;s settings under Minify > JS is set to defer JavaScript. There are two radio button settings but they are confusing.  </p>



<p>The first radio button allows users to defer selected JavaScript files. It says the files will be loaded asynchronously (not the same as defer), and then it also says that users should select the first radio button if they want to exclude scripts from page speed tests. It is not clear how the scripts will be loaded for the user or for testing sites. Excluding is not the same as deferring, so in this case the settings UI is somewhat misleading and should be more clear.</p>



<img />



<p>The second radio option is for users who are simply looking to defer all JavaScript. If one selects <em>&#8220;Defer using JavaScript (Use this method if you require support for <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_script_defer.asp">older browsers</a>),&#8221;</em> it should do exactly what it describes in the link:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If the¬†<code>defer</code>¬†attribute is set, it specifies that the script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p> Even though the UI says it is deferring all files, WP-Optimize never loads the JavaScript for performance testing sites. In this second option, the exclusion of testing sites happens without the users&#8217; permission. If users had wanted that, they would have selected the previous radio button and explicitly identified which scripts to exclude.</p>



<img />



<p>Varghese left out some significant details in his original report, but it was accurate in that certain settings are misleading about what they actually do. He demonstrated this in a follow-up video where there is no manual entry of any scripts to exclude and the second radio option is checked.</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re providing an option for users to cheat testing tools,&#8221; Varghese said. &#8220;Also, using names like &#8216;ighth&#8217; for Lighthouse and &#8216;tmetr&#8217; for GTmetrix clearly shows what they&#8217;re trying to do.</p>



<p>&#8220;Most of the users try disabling and enabling different features to see which one is increasing the speed/scores in testing tools.&#8221; </p>



<p>Varghese contends there is no need to do things differently for testing tools and humans, as this can be confusing for site owners. His allegation left out significant details and implied that all of this is hidden in the code. It is for one of the settings but not the other one. The interface implies that you must enter scripts manually to exclude from testing, but this is also misleading. </p>



<p>WP-Optimize <a href="https://getwpo.com/wp-optimize-completely-rejects-false-allegations-of-gaming-page-speed-results/">published a public response to the allegations</a> today, but has not revealed any of the results from the code investigation they completed. Instead, the company cited a video created by Peter Wilkinson from¬†<a href="https://diviengine.com/">Divi Engine</a>, who claims that users must manually enter scripts to make testing sites exclude them.</p>



<p>Wilkinson is quoted as concluding that &#8220;Gijo Varghese has used deception to promote Flying Pages and Flying Press&#8221; in bringing this issue to public attention on Twitter.</p>



<p>‚ÄúIn reality (from my research) WP-Optimize do not &#8216;cheat&#8217; Pagespeed tools when you install or Minify your JavaScript,&#8221; Wilkinson said.</p>



<p>‚ÄúTo &#8216;cheat&#8217; the tools, you need to manually add the JS files you want to asynchronous load to a setting that clearly has the label &#8216;Use this if you have a completely independent script or would like to exclude scripts from page speed tests (PageSpeed Insights, GTMetrix‚Ä¶)'&#8221;</p>



<p>This is not the case. The easiest way to test is to install the plugin, turn on &#8220;defer all JavaScript,&#8221; and then view the source to see that performance tools are excluded.</p>



<p>Since WP-Optimize&#8217;s public response to the issue did not include anything from their code investigation, I contacted them again. Their deputy lead Venkat Raj was not available to answer why other settings in the plugin silently remove JS for performance testing tools with the click of a radio button. Joe Miles, head of strategy for the company, shared the last information he received on the issue from Venkat Raj: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The advanced setting used in the allegation is actually useful to find out whether the essential js/css files are actually slowing down the web page or not.¬† This feature is by default, turned ‚Äòoff‚Äô and only enabled by advanced users who know what they‚Äôre doing.<br /><br />&#8220;You may use this feature if you have a completely independent script or would like to exclude scripts from page speed tests (PageSpeed Insights, GTMetrix&#8230;)<br /><br />&#8220;Independent scripts are for example &#8216;analytics&#8217; or &#8216;pixel&#8217; scripts. They are not required for the website to work. &#8216;<em>Use this if you have a completely independent stylesheet or would like to exclude stylesheets from page speed tests (PageSpeed Insights, GTMetrix&#8230;)</em>&#8216;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This applies to the first radio button. The second button does not have any indication that it will turn off all scripts when using testing tools &#8211; nor does WP-Optimize&#8217;s team seem to be aware that it is available with the click of a radio button. </p>



<p>Miles could not confirm whether this is how it is intended to work or if it is a bug. He also could not account for why the names of the popular testing sites were obfuscated in the code, but said the original developer &#8220;doesn&#8217;t work for us as it&#8217;s open source code repurposed from elsewhere.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;However, we believe this is a distraction from the false allegations, and what matters is that the UI is very clear for the settings are for, so users aren&#8217;t deceived,&#8221; Miles said.</p>



<p>Raul Peixoto, author of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/fast-velocity-minify/">Fast Velocity Minify</a> (FVM), the plugin from which WP-Optimize copied the code, said he can confirm that this code was part of FVM but said it was not used in the same way:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The purpose of such code on FVM was completely different than the one on WP Optimize and furthermore it required for the users to manually enable this option via wp-admin (it was disabled by default).</p>



<p>The purpose of that code was to selectively test the impact of new scripts or plugins in performance, and help developers decide if they should refactor, remove or replace heavy plugins or scripts.</p>



<p>This existed on FVM to answer questions like these:<br />‚ÄúI have a production site and my performance is low. What would be the performance if this plugin was simply not here, but without actually removing it from the site for regular users yet?‚Äù<br />‚ÄúWhat would the performance be if I could defer all scripts, or specific scripts that are not currently compatible with defer, before actually doing that change for everyone?‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>



<p>An official explanation regarding its use on FVM is <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/why-are-some-scripts-not-loaded-for-speed-testing-sites/">available in the plugin&#8217;s support forum</a> as of this morning.</p>



<p>&#8220;I suppose that the developers hired by WP Optimize did not understand what this was doing on FVM or under what settings, or perhaps, they may have felt tempted to use it as a hack,&#8221; Peixoto said.</p>



<p>&#8220;We should also carefully remember that at that time, there were still no web vitals metrics publicly available, so using something like this would have yield better &#8216;measurable&#8217; results, thus offering a product advantage.&#8221;</p>



<p>Piexoto said he &#8220;felt compelled&#8221; to remove this code two years ago because of how often it was abused by developers who were cheating on tests for their clients:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Fast forward some time, and I realized that some developers were actually using this to cheat on the tests for their clients, so I felt compelled to make the decision on FVM 3 (already late 2020) to remove this feature, which was met by a lot of protests of angry developers when their clients started complaining that their scores went down.</p>



<p>I tried at that time, to explain that having a good score was not the same as having good web vitals metrics, but eventually I gave up on that, as some people cared more about the test results than the actual performance.</p>



<p>After FVM 3 release, I am basically just maintaining it and doing small bug fixes when reported, as I have to focus on other things. I have removed that function and fixed a couple of bugs that were pending on version 3.2.9 and pushed an update, so thank you for referring this to me.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For whatever reason, UpdraftPlus chose to merge this code into WP-Optimize in 2020 and, as reported yesterday, hasn&#8217;t touched the code since. </p>



<p>What appeared to be a black and white issue yesterday is a more nuanced situation. WP-Optimize&#8217;s implementation of FVM&#8217;s code is poorly documented in the UI and misleading about how the scripts are loaded. It can lead site owners to activating it without being advanced users, and historically has a high potential for abuse. When Varghese discovered it, he exposed it in an inflammatory way, feeling certain he had found wrongdoing because of how inexplicably obfuscated the code is. This compounded the issue but started a broader, important conversation. </p>



<p>Should users have this kind of easy access (two clicks) to turning off scripts for performance testing tools? How can developers in the same industry better communicate about potential harms to users that they see in others&#8217; products? What kind of code documentation requirements should agencies implement to prevent a situation like this where code needs to be investigated over the span of days in order to find out what it is intended to do?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 22:41:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Varghese confirmed that he was testing the free version of WP-Optimize, which is used on more than a million WordPress sites. UpdraftPlus acquired WP-Optimize in 2016 and claims that the tool &#8220;has everything you need to keep your website fast and thoroughly optimized.&#8221; A <a href="https://getwpo.com/">commercial version</a> is also promoted through the free plugin that is hosted on WordPress.org.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tell me, UpdraftPlus, how I&#8217;m supposed to continue trusting your company with my clients&#8217; backups when you use these deceptive and fraudulent practices?&#8221; one customer Adam Lowe <a href="https://twitter.com/adamslowe/status/1564325514319466503">said</a> in response to Varghese&#8217;s discovery of the plugin not loading JS for performance tools. </p>



<p>&#8220;Wow, all I can say is what an utter disappointment,&#8221; WordPress agency owner and developer Brian Jackson said.</p>



<p>This type of alleged deception is eerily similar to a <a href="https://metacoffeedata.com/manipulating-google-lighthouse-results-scam-by-upwork-freelancer/">scam</a> reported by someone who contracted a performance freelancer on Upwork who artificially manipulated Google Pagespeed results. Others participating in the discussion on Twitter compared it to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal">Volkswagon emissions scandal</a> where the carmaker was found to activate its emissions controls only during laboratory testing in order to meet the EPA&#8217;s requirements after a violation. The vehicles on the road emitted up to 40 times more nitrogen oxides while driving, as compared to how they performed in the rigged laboratory tests.</p>



<p>Varghese and several other participants in the conversation concluded that this is why site owners should focus on what real world users are experiencing, instead of performance tool test scores.</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hopefully they wonder why their CrUX report data (or better, RUM data) didn't budge.

</div>



<p>Even when focusing on real user experiences, site owners often rely on the tests to diagnose issues and see how a site&#8217;s performance can be improved. They don&#8217;t expect that a plugin will be hiding JS files from performance tools. Tricking the tests has eroded WP-Optimize&#8217;s credibility.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wow. If true, this is as short sighted as it is inexcusable,&#8221; UpdraftPlus customer Johnathon William <a href="https://twitter.com/johnofhousejohn/status/1563216460737966080">said</a>. &#8220;And it makes me wonder if I can trust their other product, UpdraftPlus, which I use to backup several client sites.&#8221; </p>



<p>I contacted UpdraftPlus and lead developer David Anderson said the company was not aware of the issue with the code but related some of the backstory. UpdraftPlus was briefly in talks with the author of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/fast-velocity-minify/">Fast Velocity Minify</a> plugin about the possibility of combining forces, in which he would maintain the minification module within WP-Optimize and gain more users. Ultimately they could not come to an agreement, but during that time WP-Optimize&#8217;s developers forked and adapted Fast Velocity Minify under the GPL. The developers who worked on that adaption are no longer with the company.</p>



<p>&#8220;In the commit to our own source repository, 2.5 years ago (Jan 2020), the commit was labelled &#8216;Resolve &#8216;Add CSS and JS Minification GPL code from &#8216;Fast Velocity Minify&#8217; &#8211; Part 6&#8242;,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;Part of a series of initial merges of code that was re-factored to be cleaner and use our coding style preferences (but not change any functionality). So the apparent intention of the merge of those lines was to bring over refactored code without at that stage making any changes.</p>



<p>&#8220;According to the commit history (i.e. the &#8216;git blame&#8217; function) no changes have been made to that code since, i.e. it is as-imported. (The history for WP Optimize is public in WordPress SVN too).&#8221;</p>



<p>After a cursory examination of the code, Anderson concluded that his team may need to reexamine it, as they were not aware of what was added two years ago.</p>



<p>&#8220;As I try to trace that function through the code within the plugins, the intention&nbsp;<strong>on the face of it</strong>&nbsp;appears to be that if the website visitor is a &#8216;bot,&#8217; then code that is pointless for bots won&#8217;t be carried out,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;However having said that, 1) the bot names look to be heavily obfuscated/redacted, which is strange (why?), and&nbsp; 2) there are plenty of more obvious bots that aren&#8217;t listed there, such as the Googlebot itself. If that function was being put before me for review today, I&#8217;d certainly question why that is so. I can&#8217;t mind-read myself back 32 months ago, but, I remember it as being a long series of large patches, so it wasn&#8217;t being closely analysed on a line-by-line basis. We knew that we had identified FVM as a good plugin and our main focus was on adapting it to our structure and style, and those were the things I personally was looking at as the final reviewer.&#8221;</p>



<p>In summary, UpdraftPlus&#8217; development team was not aware of this code until the Twitter thread was published over the weekend.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m certainly glad to have it brought to our intention,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;The associated code comment on a related fragment in its original source that it&#8217;s intended to prevent unnecessary requests for bots, but on a closer examination than that line got at the time, that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll want to look at, as it does look questionable/strange, and we&#8217;ll be doing that by assigning it to a team member who&#8217;s our expert in JavaScript optimizations.&#8221;</p>



<p>Anderson also said that if the JavaScript optimization experts cannot find any legitimate purpose for the code, &#8220;it will certainly be removed,&#8221; with a clear and unambiguous disclosure for the reasoning behind it.</p>



<p>In the meantime, UpdraftPlus has <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/code-under-investigate-in-wp-optimize/#utm_medium=referral&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_content=social">published a notice</a> in the plugin&#8217;s support forum to inform users that the code is currently under investigation.</p>

<p>The theme uses core blocks to create sections that showcase the work of creative artists of all kinds. For example, the header uses the Cover block featuring a gradient image with the focal point picker set at a certain point. Site identity and navigation are organized within a group, followed by a Media and Text block header section. </p>



<p>Upon install and activation, Pentatonic delivers a good experience for users. Clicking &#8220;Customize&#8221; takes users to the Site Editor with the front page loaded, looking nearly identical to the demo for the <a href="https://fse.catchthemes.com/pentatonic-free/">free version</a>.</p>



<img />



<p>Pentatonic comes with 17 block patterns that users can easily mix and match to create their own unique pages. These include patterns for About Us, Call to Action, Featured Content, Sidebar, Music Podcasts, 404 Header, Archive header, Default footer, Footer with three columns, Default header, Recent with blog sidebar, Post header, Header with buttons, and more. Each section on the homepage can be recreated using a pattern on other pages or repeated/rearranged on the front page.</p>



<img />



<p>The theme also includes 11 templates and eight template parts, allowing users to make customizations to the 404 page, blog single posts, search results, post content, and others. </p>



<p>The pro version of the theme includes access to custom blocks, such as a playlist, case study, skills bar, masonry, popup video, and more. The <a href="https://fse.catchthemes.com/pentatonic-pro/">demo for the pro version</a> has a sticky music player at the bottom of the page, promotional popup video, podcast playlist, and other custom media additions that bands and artists may require.</p>



<p>Pentatonic has been optimized to respond well to all screen sizes and looks just as good on mobile as it does on desktop. The theme is <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/pentatonic/">available for free on WordPress.org</a> where you can preview all the patterns and check out a preview of the whole theme in action that strongly resembles the demo hosted on Catch Themes.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 21:38:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-23/digitalocean-to-buy-web-hosting-firm-cloudways-for-350-million">Huge news in the hosting space</a>! <strong>DigitalOcean</strong> is set to acquire <strong>Cloudways</strong> for $350 million (USD). From a development perspective I hope this enables Cloudways to innovate even more in the coming years, but it does immediately pose the question: will DigitalOcean keep their competitors' hosting services available on Cloudways. All signs point to the same business-as-usual, but only time will truly tell. Regardless, big congrats to Post Status members over there, <strong>Robert Jacobi</strong> and <strong>Zach Stepek</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Fr√§nk Klein</strong> over at WordPress agency <strong>Human Made</strong> is asking us to <a href="https://humanmade.com/2022/08/24/can-we-please-stop-saying-gutenberg/">stop saying ‚ÄòGutenberg‚Äô.</a> This makes sense. We need to have a consistent vocabulary on how we talk about these things to each other and to stakeholders so we all understand what we‚Äôre discussing. I‚Äôve gotten into the habit of saying ‚Äúthe Block Editor‚Äù when talking about the new interface for page building in core, but I never thought that we could also break down explaining the various parts to full site editing as well. Human Made does a good job of clarifying all of this, and it might even be a great addition to the WordPress documentation to have all these defined right up front somewhere.</p>



<p>Speaking of hosting companies, Post Status members <strong>Sam Munoz</strong> and <strong>Brian Gardner</strong> from <strong>WPEngine</strong> have started <a href="https://wpengine.com/builders/build-mode-live-july-2022-sessions/">a regular Zoom meeting</a> called <strong>Build Mode Live</strong> to help anyone with their questions and struggles around full site editing, the block editor, WordPress, and how it all impacts business owners. They‚Äôre bringing a design, development, builder, and business owner perspective to an area where we haven‚Äôt seen much open discussion. <a href="https://calendly.com/bgardner-wpe/build-mode?month=2022-09">You can sign up to participate right now</a>!</p>



<p>On the <strong>Make WordPress Design</strong> blog <strong>Channing Ritter</strong>, Design Director at <strong>Automattic</strong>, shared a reminder that there is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/08/24/tt3-default-theme-one-week-left-to-submit-style-variations/">one week left to submit a variation to be included in the new Twenty Twenty Three theme</a> (TT3). There‚Äôs a <strong>Figma</strong> file <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/08/10/twenty-twenty-three-default-theme-project-kickoff/">attached to Channing's kickoff post</a> you can use for the variations. This builds on <a href="https://poststatus.com/tech-roundup-for-the-week-of-august-15-2022/">the tools I shared last week</a> that reinforce the importance of a build flow from Figma to WordPress. All of it is very encouraging! It's great to see this process improving.</p>

<p>Have you been struggling with the lack of features in the block editor that you‚Äôve grown accustomed to having in a page builder? <a href="https://wpeditorplus.com">That is where <strong>Editor Plus</strong> comes in</a>! It helps you set background, margin, padding, icons, tabs, accordions, ratings, and even animation. I like most that these settings also stay in place even when you switch themes, keeping it from locking you into a specific theme forever. The plugin is led by serial developer <strong>Munir Kamal</strong>, who also runs <strong>Editors Kit</strong> and <strong>Gutenberg Hub</strong>. A bonus for users of this plugin is that there are also a ton of great video tutorials on how to extend Editor Plus to do almost anything.</p>

In a recent post titled <a href="https://jameskoster.design/2022/08/24/revising-the-presentation-of-key-site-editor-features/">Revising the presentation of key Site Editor¬†features</a>, Koster identifies unbalanced feature weighting as a critical design flaw that is negatively impacting users&#8217; experience with the editor:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Site Editor is a powerful tool, but the user experience lacks some coherence and a sense of hierarchy.</p>



<p>Template management and editing has central focus, despite the fact that it‚Äôs a product area that has proven difficult for some users to interpret.</p>



<p>Impactful features like style and menu management are hierarchically relegated, and consequently deliver a sub-optimal UX.</p>



<p>This week I‚Äôve been ideating on how we might present site editor features with more appropriate weighting, so that the overall experience feels more like a design tool.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Instead of dropping users directly into editing the homepage, Koster contends that the Site Editor&#8217;s design should be updated to become a &#8220;navigable frame&#8221; where users can select from a menu of features and styles on the left. This is a radical improvement over the current experience, which feels like walking into a room with all the lights on and multiple features competing for attention.</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>&#8220;The combination of the site frame (<a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/23328">Browse mode</a>) and one-click editing helps to obfuscate some of the aforementioned confusion around template editing,&#8221; Koster said. &#8220;Now you simply browse to the page you want to update, and click ‚ÄòEdit‚Äô.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another idea Koster explored is a view that makes it easier to understand the interaction of styles and templates. The UI is much cleaner and drastically reduces the cognitive load for users who are struggling to grasp the concept of templates in the first place.</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>Identity and homepage configuration options haven&#8217;t found a place in the site editor yet. Koster proposed bringing them into the editor in a similar fashion to how it was previously presented in the Customizer, with live previews.</p>



<img />



<p>Koster also proposes organizing features like templates, template parts, reusable blocks, and patterns in a &#8220;Design Library&#8221; section, presented via a grid of thumbnails that would open the edit view. This would bring a new level of organization to a set of tools that are currently scattered throughout the site editor interface.</p>



<p>These are just a few highlights from his explorations. Although Koster articulates many of the Site Editor&#8217;s current pain points, his designs present an elegant solution for each. Check out the <a href="https://jameskoster.design/2022/08/24/revising-the-presentation-of-key-site-editor-features/">full post</a> to see all the videos and other ideas for organizing features in the site editor.</p>



<p>The disparity between the current experience and Koster&#8217;s mockups is like a night and day Cinderella style transformation. It&#8217;s a powerful example of how thoughtful design can really solve problems. His explorations received positive feedback from those eager to see these designs implemented in Gutenberg. Koster said his next step is to prepare some simpler prototypes for collaboration on GitHub.</p>



<p>&#8220;The ideas are still formative, but¬†with some pruning we can get things into a shippable state,&#8221; Koster said. &#8220;My next step is to refine and prototype a more stripped-back version, and take that to GitHub for wider thoughts and feedback.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 15:13:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Since I like pretty much everything Bruce says (that I can understand) I tried to get my head around this and <a href="https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02M81N9YEM/p1660856386106519">the discussion it spawned</a> in <a href="https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02M81N9YEM/p1660856386106519">Post Status Slack</a> with <a href="https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02M81N9YEM/p1660856386106519">Rowley</a> and <a href="https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02M81N9YEM/p1660856386106519">JJJ</a>. </p>



<p>Bruce's summary:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The paper is about cryptocurrency wallet design, but the ideas are more general. Ittay points out that a key‚Äîor an account, or anything similar‚Äîcan be in one of four states:<br /><br /><strong>safe</strong> Only the user has access,<br /><strong>loss</strong> No one has access,<br /><strong>leak</strong> Both the user and the adversary have access, or<br /><strong>theft</strong> Only the adversary has access.</p><p>Once you know these states, you can assign probabilities of transitioning from one state to another (someone hacks your account and locks you out, you forgot your own password, etc.) and then build optimal security and reliability to deal with it. It‚Äôs a truly elegant way of conceptualizing the problem.</p></blockquote>



<p>I think of it more like this, since it's how most people actually operate:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Secure:</strong> Only I have access (as far as I know)<ul><li><strong>Strong Secure:</strong> Proper strong, unique passwords, 2FA</li><li><strong>Weak Secure:</strong> Weak, reused passwords, no 2FA (OK for trivial sites that require a login, bad for your bank account.)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Loss:/Lockout</strong> No one has access</li><li><strong>Shared:</strong> I and designated others have access, which could easily become:<ul><li><strong>Leak:</strong> Undesignated, unknown others have access, which could easily become:<ul><li><strong>Theft/Breach</strong>: An adversary has access <ul><li><strong>Theft and Lockout:</strong> An adversary has access and may have broadly leaked or shared access with others, but I am locked out.</li><li><strong>Theft and No Lockout:</strong> My account has been hacked but I can still get in. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Avoid Sharing/Leaking with strong secure accounts, and the probability of theft/breach is much, much lower. </p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">In this episode, Dan and Ny talk about WordPress and giving back. Giving, making, creating&#8230; Looking at the search results for  &#8220;Make WordPress&#8221; and &#8220;the firehose&#8221; of Make WordPress Slack where the #docs channel was having their weekly meeting, Dan and Ny look at the wide range of options there are for new contributors.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>I would say you're contributing by learning. Like if you're, if you're learning in community, that's a step deeper in.</em></p><cite>Dan Knauss</cite></blockquote>



<p>Mentoring and organizing Meetups is a topic that comes up again. That's where Ny feels she has been given the most and most enjoys giving back. However, there are barriers to getting people engaged with the WordPress project ‚Äî and to work for free.</p>



<p>Dan asks what needs to be done to reach younger people. Ny talks about the barriers from a BIPOC perspective, where sensitivity to history and personal stories matters. Dan relates that to an inner city gardening project he volunteered with that had an all-white leadership team. If contributing is a privilege, how can we help elevate more people to that level of privilege?</p>



<p><strong>Also covered:</strong></p>



<ul><li>How does the older open source culture of contribution (not) translate to the contemporary culture of the &#8220;creator economy?&#8221;</li><li>Dan's initial experience with trying to onboard himself in #docs.</li></ul>

<h1 id="h-transcript">Transcript</h1>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> [00:00:00] Good morning Ny.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Good morning, Dan. How are you?</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> All right. It's an earlier one than, than we usually do, but that's good. Start the day. Um, yeah, so I thought we could, we could talk about, um, contribution and contributors and, and what that means in the, in the word. community where, um, I don't know, you, we probably both have about the same level of outside in kind of experience with it.</p>



<p>So, um, I'm not the expert or anything, but, um, mm-hmm, , I could tell you what my, my experience is and how I'm, I'm looking at that. And some of the discussions that are going on about what it, what contribution means or could mean. And, um, Yeah, how's that sound? What's what's yours? What is it? What comes to mind when, when you hear that word in the [00:01:00] WordPress context?</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, I guess, uh, the same it's, it's the same when I hear it in like, you know, outside in life contribution means giving back. It means helping, it means providing, um, and, uh, you know, it's the same in WordPress. So definitely down to talk about this today, and I'm very interested to hear your thoughts.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, it's I, I think it's, um, it's the core part of the, the project that is the oldest, um, feature of it.</p>



<p>The oldest foundations of it, that's very, very open source, very old, um, old part of open. As Matt has said in, in some talks, like give a penny, take a penny kind of, kind of ethic. Um, really kind of going back, I guess, to like Linux and the seventies [00:02:00] and early and earlier generation. And I wonder sometimes if like after millennials or so if, if that's things have changed a lot and that's not.</p>



<p>Understood. There's kind of a, a reciprocity there. You use the software, it's free. It's open. Um, how are, how can you, the more you get engaged with it as a user, as a developer, um, someone maybe profiting from it. How, how do you give back and does that, does that just happen naturally through the relationships that arise?</p>



<p>Or not. And how do we move really? How do we move the, the project forward? And, um, I was just looking this morning. Like if you, if you, um, I was, I was just Googling make WordPress. So there's the whole make.wordpress.org, um, page where you get the list of all the core core teams and, um, [00:03:00] If you search for make WordPress, you get three ads.</p>



<p>First, first for WP engines, WordPress page builder, wordpress.com WordPress page builder element, or for WordPress, create it with Elementor, um, the create and build language. So, uh, most people these days, um, and, and they're targeting what people wanna do. Uh, how do you just make something with WordPress?</p>



<p>Create and build. But I'm looking for the old school. How do I contribute back? Where, where the you're budding developer designer, just helping, like helping out. We're always looking for people to help make WordPress even better. Um, and there, what you can give back goes into all these teams that, uh, we now have a performance team.</p>



<p>It hasn't changed a ton. It's, it's rare for them to add. So we got the core and that's really like the fundamental. Thing here, if we don't move word breast core [00:04:00] forward, how much does anything else matter? But there's so much else people can give and do that really is essential too. You don't don't want to deemphasize that design mobile mobile team is now been more explicitly defined as that's open source that.</p>



<p>That's not, um, that's not something that is tied to jet pack or.com. And you, you wanna work on iOS and Android apps, Java objective C swift. Um, that's a, that's a whole nother section accessibility. Polyglots multilingual, uh, translation, WordPress support, uh, support forums. What,</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> uh, what stands out to you the most out of all of those?</p>



<p>What, what do you think? Like, not what's most important, but, um, cuz that's subjective. Um, which one would you be like most interested in contributing to? Yeah. Which one do you think speaks to you the most? When you read through the list? [00:05:00]</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And I was, I was, I've been thinking about that. So then there's documentation and that's where I've been trying to kind of learn, figure out how to get in.</p>



<p>And that's, that's kind of where it, it isn't that easy. It isn't that easy. maybe, you know, some people or if you have a deeper connection, but from that straight outside in it's it's tricky documentation, themes, plugins, community. Training test TV marketing, CLI WordPress CLI the VP CLI uh, hosting tide, open verse photos for performance.</p>



<p>Um, there's really a lot of different skill sets that could be attractive. And a lot of things you could do, but to be honest, the, um, my, my experience is, um, I haven't really done like. Contribution in the form of little patches and bug reports and stuff since way back, like, you know, they're still using tra have you, do you have much SVN experience?</p>



<p>that's what we were all using like 20 years [00:06:00] ago on source project. WordPress is still using. Um, so, so yeah, there's all these, all these different teams that are maybe attractive to different skill sets you may have or different people, um, May have, and, um, core is really at the center of it. And there's all, all these other things orbiting around that, um, or orbiting around the community and, and serving it or around mobile app.</p>



<p>Um, and yeah, finding your way into it, I think is, is. Is the trick. Um, once someone gets interested in, in doing that and bringing, bringing new folks in and smoothing the onboarding, um, is probably, um, something we need to pay more attention to. It's tough. I, Brian mm-hmm Brian cords was, was writing about [00:07:00] that.</p>



<p>Did he, um, So he, he talks about his experience. I'm, I'm kind of doing the same thing. Try, can I put in a few hours a week, I've been trying to follow, just look at the docs program, you know, cause writing, editing that's mm-hmm, , that's probably the easiest thing for me. I've I've done little bug reports and patches and, and things before.</p>



<p>And I go back a long way. So SVN or, you know, was something I was using way before GitHub existed get was a thing. Um, but it's, it's. It's quite amazed of, of things and a lot of customs and etiquettes and rituals, parts of the culture to, to understand, um, to get started. So I feel like there's like a long watching, reading, learning, asking questions, maybe getting mentored, um, phase you have to go through, um, have you taken a look at like the.</p>



<p>Would make [00:08:00] WordPress slack at all.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I have not. And I'm going to be completely honest. Um, I will eventually, I am just in so many slack channels right now. I don't think I can. I don't think I can possibly take on that one. Um, I've heard it's it's a lot. I, I just cannot do it. I'm in like work slacks. I have like my mentoring slacks that I do official mentoring with.</p>



<p>I have like slacks I was in before I, um, got. Um, tech and I still help people there. I just, uh, if I join one more, I think my head will explode. Yeah. But please enlighten me to what usually goes on</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> here. Well, I'm not an expert, I'm trying to figure out the same as you and, and, and Brian and, um, yeah, I think the reality is, is yet they call it the fire hose for reason.</p>



<p>It's, it's probably, one of the busiest slacks and consistently for so long, this major, um, Of [00:09:00] information and cooperation. Um, so it's daunting, it's intimidating to, um, to look at how to get into, um, but it there's there's method to the madness and what I've learned, just kind of following along and looking at, at things in a, in a pretty traditional way.</p>



<p>I, I assume the. Other teams work like this, but like docs. Um, we have a, um, a meeting every Tuesday morning at this time. So 8, 8, 8 am. I'm kind of following, um, on my phone here and people kind of check in. I can make it, I can't make it. Um, melanic cap is, um, one, the leader there and one of the leaders and you'd probably like her.</p>



<p>She's a ump developer. Um, who's kind an advocate. For PHP as well. Who's been doing docs for a long time. So you developer literacy is really important if you're gonna write [00:10:00] docs and guides for, for things that directly deal with that. But there's so much else you don't have to be. You don't have to have any particular code depth.</p>



<p>There's so much other documentation going on. Um, and that's probably starting to overlap some with the training materials that are another team. That's a. Newer thing that will help onboard people, I think, to have training and then also mentoring happening all these meetups that are relatively new, um, community.</p>



<p>Yeah. Is that I'm not sure what group that's what if that's happening under the community team? I think that's all that's under the training team. Mm-hmm uh,</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> what the meetups,</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> oh, that you're talking about. Yeah. They're make they're they're coming out of the core. So they're, there are, um, Hannah tab. For this somewhere.</p>



<p>Um,</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Organizing the meetups, which is what I'm doing in [00:11:00] Columbia, South Carolina. And I always say the city and not the state and Charlotte, North Carolina, mm-hmm um, falls more under community. We've been all over there. Yeah. Trying to get things, uh, settled for it. Um, that's that's my area of export.</p>



<p>Expertise, but it's still really, really hard. Um, , I I've, I've organized a lot of things and this might be the hardest honestly. And I don't know if, if it's, you know, because it's so specialized or what, but, um, still really excited. And I just I'm, I just can't wait to, you know, have that set up as my contribution and like spread it.</p>



<p>That's like my goal for it. Yeah. That</p>



<p>would</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Def that would be under, under community. Um, Yeah, it's actually is I guess, something you could get into and start doing in your own, um, in your own city and a lot happens outside of slack, outside of, um, Outside of this, but that there's the community team. And mm-hmm</p>



<p>I was, I was speaking of, um, the, the newer meetups that [00:12:00] are sponsored by learn, um, WordPress. So there's, there's probably some increasing overlap between community and training, which is a good thing. There, there are all these meetups that are happening as virtual. Um, there's a schedule, there's a calendar on here where people like, um, um, People who are directly involved in working on Gutenberg.</p>



<p>Like, uh, Nick Diego, I saw I had had one coming up, um, uh, will be doing live workshops so you can go and get, get some knowledge from, from people who are directly working on, um, on newer parts of, of WordPress and. so some of that is higher, higher level stuff for, um, developers, designers, and some of it is oriented towards people who might be really new to using WordPress in different ways.</p>



<p>So training's [00:13:00] close to mentoring and close to community building. So that's kind of a neat area where, um, where people can. Brought in and, um, connected. And I would say you're contributing by learning. Like if you're, if you're learning in community, , that's like step in mm-hmm um, for a lot of people, um, I noticed that, so we have this weekly thing that Daniel Chut Smith is doing, um, for us where he's rounding up.</p>



<p>Um, What's going on and what's catching his eye, uh, design and development. And this, his last Roundup was mostly stuff coming from.org from make, create your first app with Gutenberg data. So using react. Um, so Adams Linsky put together a nice tutorial. That's showing you how to do that. That's a link to, um, developer, the developer section of word, wordpress.org.</p>



<p>Block theme builders, Figma [00:14:00] of building a workflow from Figma Figma to your block theme. You're trying to create, that's a learn WordPress online workshop. So that's, that's one of these things I'm talking about. That's a meet up. So, um, you can sign up and, and do that. There that's an intermediate level for an audience of builders.</p>



<p>So people who may not be high, um, Deep into code, um, high level development stuff. That's okay. This is, um, working from Figma to your block template. Are you, are you doing anything, any front end stuff like that, or mostly have these database backend projects you're working on.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I'm doing everything. But, um, mostly right now I am working with the database.</p>



<p>Um, mostly when I talk to my mentors and they want me to show them, like, I always get the question. Uh, can you show me what you do at work or a day in the life of you? Mm-hmm and, um, I don't show them my [00:15:00] calendar. I don't wanna scare them away, but, um, uh, usually it's front end work with them, um, because that's what, you know, they learn first and most are interested in, so.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, I have not gotten away from front end work because that's the first thing that newbies wanna see. Oh yeah. How it works in WordPress. And I think, uh, WordPress is great for front end development. So that's my way of trying to get them into the community as well. So I throw in my community stuff like, Hey, you know, we're gonna have meet up soon.</p>



<p>If you want to come and learn more about the community and that's my sales pitch. And that's how I, that's how I get. That's how I'm getting people into the community.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. It's great to see that there's so many levels like, yeah, we're gonna reach out to builders, to people who are totally new to it, to people are maybe doing freelance or agency work.</p>



<p>Um, I was hinting earlier, like when you, if you search for this, like the way that, the way that a lot of companies, including, um, wordpress.com and automatic or. [00:16:00] Presenting WordPress to the world is to the creator economy and to, to people, I just wanna build something. I wanna start my business online. I, and, and their first thought is I don't not to understand anything about open source or that there's a community behind that or what, that, that, there's this, uh, culture of contribution and open source.</p>



<p>That's a long, that's a long way up later. Mm-hmm and , I wrote something where I, I, I feel like, you know, we really have. Embrace that. And I see that happening on the marketing level, on the commercial side to a lot of WordPress companies. Um, and I, I even noticed like, as, as the.com, um, I, when they did their first price change, I got the bargain and I up upgraded my longstanding account.</p>



<p>I have a.blog blog and a bunch of other sites there. And. Um, you can, there's the marketplace there. You can install and do a lot in.com. Now you can install Elementor I've not seen that [00:17:00] before. So you could, you could pop that in on wordpress.com and start building with that if you want. And they're very oriented towards a, a builder, um, creator economy approach, but getting people inside is like the key thing.</p>



<p>Like, however you come, however you come, come, as you are. I think like that needs to be more of. Our approach. And as cuz people aren't gonna, the average person, isn't gonna go to.org, the make thing there, and look at these core teams and, and, and go like, okay. Yeah. I, I see where I fit. Like I, you and I would, would struggle with that.</p>



<p>Like it's gonna, it's gonna take weeks and, and months to probably get, um, to get comfortable. And that's, that's cool. That's fine. That's how you build relationships, but it's not. It's not like on the instant gratification level of, let me build my site today, which you wanna do as quickly as as you can. Um, [00:18:00]</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I think it's even, um, even for people like me who will sit down and take their time, um, when things are presented to them, It's so much to go through sometimes depending on what you want to do.</p>



<p>And like you said, like it's not an easy thing to jump into. It's it's making that time too. I know, like for me right now, I get asked every week, like, how are you doing everything you do? And sometimes, I don't know, but, um, like. I think it's easier for me to still contribute because like, I, I didn't go into this.</p>



<p>Like, Hey, I have to make myself fit to one of these. I went into this as, this is what I already do. This is something I'm good at, how can I connect this with WordPress? So I think that's an easier way. And then like that allowed me to like, okay, I can make time to, you know, set this. I have a partner helping me.</p>



<p>Um, Ken, yeah. Elliot is helping, um, well, he's the mastermind. I'm helping him. Um, and, um, I think that's a easier way, but I agree with you a hundred percent. [00:19:00] Um, that's, you know, just when you were reading them off, I'm like, this is a lot. And then when you get into them, it's like, you have to break it down and that's a lot.</p>



<p>So I think if we have like more. I guess people like me or you cuz you did it too. When you talked about how, you know, you're a writer and documentation probably would be your strongest point and you've done some of it before. I think people getting people like us to talk to people and say, well, this is how we did it.</p>



<p>That would definitely help people a lot because it's a little overwhelming.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. It, it is. And yeah. Well, if what I, what I found is that it's probably your own sense of, um, my own sense of in, in, uh, you don't want to be ask of the dumb question, but, or, you know, You have to put yourself out there. So they're very encouraging.</p>



<p>Like who's got questions who needs help. You know, you, you, people will take the time and, and show you. And I've, I've got like an accumulated list of tabs and, and links where I need to, I need to take some time and watch this UN WordPress TV. Right. I need to read through this and figure it out. [00:20:00] I, um, a couple weeks ago, I, you know, figured out how they're using good Gutenberg on, um, GitHub, a little deeper and, and how to, um, How to submit, um, changes on, uh, there's there's documentation, that's written into code, uh, in WordPress.</p>



<p>So, and sometimes it's wrong or, or changes. So you have to, you have to actually commit, um, changes to comments that are embedded in PHP code somewhere. Um, Things like that there's a wide range of, of stuff, but how all these workflows and things work and it just takes some time to, to learn. And it's, it's pretty satisfying once you figure it out and you are like, okay, I fixed, I fixed that.</p>



<p>do this.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, it definitely</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> is. Yeah. And in the process you might find some more bugs or things and stuff like that to, to put in. Um, but just a little here and there is, is, um, is really a good thing. [00:21:00] Um, I, I. People on the whole are, are really welcoming. It is, it is just getting past that fire hose and here, here's what I need to forget all that other stuff.</p>



<p>Here's what I need to focus on. And it's probably cool doing the meetups or mentoring, which, um, is gonna become more and more a part of the training and community. I, um, I don't have, I'd like to get more details on this, but I, I see SFA has been, been saying things about mentoring as. Becoming a more explicit form of contribution, mentoring, how to do word camps and, and so on.</p>



<p>And mm-hmm , and that they, there is probably some mentoring program coming down the line, along with training. So if you're doing, you want to go and do, um, a meetup, um, tutorial of some kind or do that in the context of your own meetups, totally contributing. And then I that's, that's probably accessible to a lot of people cuz most of the work is.</p>



<p>Gonna be, I would assume relationships and [00:22:00] stuff like in your community. So you don't like, you don't start from slack, you don't start from, from all that. That's kind of where you go to maybe get support. And, um, the main, the main thing is really the people stuff. So if that's, that's what turns you on and, and motivates you?</p>



<p>Um, yeah, that's totally essential contributing out there in. Real life relationships, um, locally where you're, you're starting. How's that going with? Um, Greenville and, um, or green wait, Greensboro.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> no, not Greenville. Um, not Greensboro. Um, I think you're, you're getting me nice or green mixed up with those I'm I'm joking. Um, so char Charlotte and Columbia. Okay. I don't know where Columbia .</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Go ahead. Sorry. I used Greenville in my head like Greenville, South Carolina, you know, I used to live [00:23:00] in Raleigh mm-hmm Durham, chapel hill area.</p>



<p>Actually. I don't know if you know that area that well, Carrie and Carrie and table mm-hmm . Yeah. Um,</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> yeah, I, I really love that area actually. Um, uh, you, uh, now there was a, uh, Greenville, uh, WordPress meetup for a long time. Um, and I think like a lot of people in Columbia, even though there was one in Columbia at one point, I think a lot of people in Columbia had to go to Greenville for that one.</p>



<p>So you may be thinking about that. Cuz Greenville, I think had a longer, a one that lasted longer than ours. In Columbia. Um, but we're right now, if we were to start one in Columbia, to my knowledge, cuz I always check out Greenville, Columbia, Charleston, the big major cities, to my knowledge, we would be the only one in the state right now.</p>



<p>I'm gonna double check on that. But the last I checked a few months ago. Yeah, we would be the only one. So I. It definitely would help. And like, we really want to spread the knowledge because Columbia's in the, in the middle of the state. Right. That's why I chose Columbia, not just because I [00:24:00] was from there, but it's in the middle of the state.</p>



<p>Mm-hmm, , we're an hour and a half to almost anywhere in the state, maybe two max. And so if people have to make that drive, which, you know, if they can, that's fine. If they can, we still wanna do it, uh, in a way that will. You know, semi virtual and recording recorded. So we're setting that up as well. Um, cuz we know South Carolina is very rural and we don't have great public transportation.</p>



<p>So, um, it's really going to help a lot because it's going to reach all throughout our state, which is not known for tech at all, Charleston and Greenville, more Southern Columbia. So. It's going to help a lot and it's going really, really well. Um, we have a place, um, we have food, uh, so many different companies reached out to me because they saw what I was doing and wanted to help goad wants to feed us.</p>



<p>You know, my company master WP wants to feed us and master WP is actually sponsoring our, um, sponsoring us and taking care of our venue. Um, we [00:25:00] have people offering to send us. Things to give out to newbies. Um, I have Courtney Robertson, which is, she's been such a great help who has just offered to give out so many learning materials.</p>



<p>Yeah. Um, I ju just the outpouring of support and then we can take that and spread it. It's just been, it's been a community effort, so it definitely meetups are definitely community. I see why it's under that label and I'm just so excited. Like I'm going to like spam everyone's Twitter when. You know, get up and running and we have pictures and video and things like that because, um, I think, you know, I agree with Josepha Josepha is really, really great to talk to, and I love how she answers questions and it's always very transparent.</p>



<p>And, um, it's, it's awesome that she's going to expand that because we can definitely take these materials and, you know, help with that and make sure people can do it in their states. Maybe their states don't have any work camp meetups or WordPress meetups.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. There's probably, uh, It'd be interesting to look at a, a Pinboard, you know, [00:26:00] map of, you know, where we, where there's activity and yeah.</p>



<p>Some are very established and been around a long time. Some come and go. The, I know the local Edmonton one. Um, yeah, pretty much ended just around the time I, I moved here. There's one in there's, one in Calgary. Um, and I've talked with some people there about, about all that. Um, you know, it, it's a, it's a takes a lot to.</p>



<p>To get things, uh, rolling again, but there's wherever you go, there's kind of an existing WordPress builder community. I, I, I sense there's a lot of people freelancing or, and there's a bunch of agencies and my, this was true even when, before WordPress was that adopted probably at that level. And I was doing more with, um, with June law and some other DRAL and other, other CMS, um, related things.</p>



<p>That a lot of people just get in to scratch their rich and build something. And, and then they [00:27:00] start doing that as a job and maybe they develop an agency or something. And so there's, there's a bunch of people who are like an unorganized, the lump and proletariat of word press, who are like, uh, they're not organized into, um, into a, a regular meetup.</p>



<p>Exactly. Um, but the potential is there mm-hmm , maybe it comes in and goes at at times, cuz there there're people who would fit the kind of WordPress professional or the line between the hazy line amateur and, and professional and doing this for myself and or which often turns into this is my job. Um, but it's, it's often secondary and I think that's an, that's been tough for the.</p>



<p>The project. And I wonder if there's, if there's a, that's kind of where contributor language gets gets complicated. And I wonder if we should like focus more on creativity and creation and there's all these people who are sort of [00:28:00] on the outer edges, who, who are very versed, inward press or using it in some significant way, but they haven't really connected deeper.</p>



<p>Into the community. And they're definitely contributing in the sense of, um, teaching and informing and expanding the market and expanding the brand, but, um, how they find their way into. These other, um, layers of the onion towards core contribution. Um, it's, it's tough cause you don't wanna make it sound like, well, what you're doing isn't worth as much mm-hmm um, cause it it's as they're all different, but to drive things forward, you do need people to come in who get more of that kinda leadership level to organize, meet up.</p>



<p>Mentor people, um, submit patches, um, get involved in, [00:29:00] in actual software development, which yeah. Is hard not to, not to privilege. Cause that's really a key, that's what we're all using. That's what either falls behind or, or innovates and yeah. What do, what do you think about that? Do you, are you think there's ways in our language that can be kind of offputting?</p>



<p>Sometimes it's like this inner circle of, of people who give back and are. Are you adequate is it can maybe be an easy feeling of, uh, of inadequacy or imposter syndrome that's RI and, and things, and, and that language can kinda land heavily on, on you.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh, yeah, definitely. Um, especially, you know, that's something that goes beyond tech, but, um, when we're talking specifically about us right here. Yeah. That can be off putting you. You have to think. Um, I do a lot of community service. because that's just how I am. That's just how I was raised. That's just me as a person, but I'm smart enough also to acknowledge [00:30:00] it's tough to get people to work for free.</p>



<p>Yeah, it's tough. Um, that's something that's drilled that was drilled into my head from, um, From a young age. And we talked a little bit about that on one of our other podcasts, like how American slavery, like is affecting people to this day. And it's like, there's no way anybody in my family from the oldest members, my great aunts to the youngest, my little baby niece, none of them would just sit and smile.</p>



<p>If I told them I was working, doing anything for free outside of C. Help. So , and it's like, it doesn't even have to be that deep for a lot of people. People are just not working for free mm-hmm, , we're in a very capitalist society. Um, we, things cost money. You know, things are high right now. Um, but again, not even getting that deep, it's just hard for some people to just work for free.</p>



<p>And also for people who want to do it time. Time is such a big constraint. So you may have people that are out there. They're like, I wanna do this. Yeah. But I [00:31:00] don't know how I wanna do this. And I don't have the time. And now these people are telling me that I'm not enough. If I'm not doing this, man, I'm not doing it.</p>



<p>So, you know, I, I see how it can lead there. Um, I, I, I definitely see that. Um, sometimes, you know, I, I it's, it, it is, it does seem like that at times, but it's just going to depend on you as a person, like stuff like that. Won't bother me personally, because if I can't do something, I can't do it. Yeah. I don't have the time.</p>



<p>I don't have the time, but I, I get it. I definitely get it. Um, I, I'm not sure though how. I'm not sure how to pull people in, who may be feeling that like it, they may have that imposter syndrome now. Um, is there just like extra reassurance? What do you think? What, what do you think could be clarified in the language to get those, to, to kind of pull those people back?</p>



<p>I, I think that</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> the more channels, the more way, ways in the, the better off you are, if it, I feel like in the past, it's [00:32:00] like, that's the only thing, like.org make page. You either figure out how to get into a team here, you hit the support forum. You, you, you find you come in through some local group. Um, there are only a couple, couple ways to do it and it, uh, it is all in this open source contribution code, committing focus, and that's become less and less.</p>



<p>I think that was alwa that's always, always been a subculture and it's become probably more and more of one. um, I think younger generations too, are in a totally different space in because it's social, um, realities, like, I don't know how much we've really addressed that. I mean, there are long term prolonged economic contraction.</p>



<p>Um, not everyone's doing that. Mm-hmm well, emotionally. With stable income and employment. Mm-hmm [00:33:00] you can't assume stuff like that there, it we've been through the most stressful. Yeah. I, I don't know if we're really through it, you know, like you turn on the news and it people all around the world. And even in, in places that are, are fairly affluent it's, there's a lot, there's a lot more stress and tension in, in life.</p>



<p>And people have lost, uh, friends and loved ones either, you know? They're no longer living. Um, that happens normally, but we just pandemic. Um, there's but there's so many, especially as you have a community to ages and, and goes along. I, I think a lot of us who've been in there a long time. Um, there's time of life things.</p>



<p>It's, I, it would be more sensitive to that all. And, and what you're saying too about. there's cultural and, and definitely racial differences that I think are hard to see from the outside. You're making me think of, um, mm-hmm, how the, a [00:34:00] good metaphor for this is when I, one of the things I did, I did a ton of, I lived in a part of Milwaukee that was, um, and otherwise it's very second.</p>



<p>Maybe people would say an apartheid city that has some. Entrenched in difficult problems and living in one of really the only area that's, that's fairly mixed and, and diverse is volunteerism is a key thing there. And it's tough. People don't have necessarily have a bunch, but there's this huge. They don't necessarily have the means or whatever, but they.</p>



<p>There's just such a drive to do community projects together and fix stuff. And gardening became more and more community gardens and stuff like that. Victory gardens. Yeah. Well, when I first started doing that, I was, um, I was doing it with, uh, uh, a church that had an interesting history. And so we had mostly African American kids coming to the summer program and, and trying to make a.[00:35:00]</p>



<p>Lots of vacant lots where stuff has been torn down or burned down over the years and in my neighborhood there. And, um, trying to build a, make a garden and, um, this same, it, it it's, it wasn't so much the work for free, cuz we, it was all hitched up to, um, You you come and you work on this, you get paid a certain kind of gift allowance.</p>



<p>And then we like try to explain banking and like walk down the street to the, the local bank on Martin Luther king drive. And like, this is how money works and like save a little. And , uh, give a little back and, and think about what your long term plans are for what you want to get. It was, it was honestly very white, middle class kind of skiing.</p>



<p>very good in very good intentions, but the first barrier is, um, these are kids who have like zero, um, [00:36:00] there in that area. Um, Their, their experience is all urban for, um, probably one or two generations. But before that down the Mississippi deep south, not a good agricultural experience share, you know, share cropping, you know, extended forms of Neo slavery.</p>



<p>Uh, you know, until grandparents, parents came up in the fifties, forties, fifties, and got the last of the good industrial jobs before that all went, went in part. Um, so, mm. I realized and read some things. Um, I never read something. I can't remember who it was, but there was a, there was a local guy and then someone else rare, uh, voices of African Americans who got on the land and were farming got, you know, as free farmers.</p>



<p>Some people came all the way up here in Alberta and did that Canada. And it's not the typical voice. And they talked about how hard it is to do. [00:37:00] Things like with the land, from an African American perspective, cuz there's such an alienation from it some of the time. And so these kids, oh yeah, they would not wear, like they didn't have grungy clothes.</p>



<p>They would wear like their best white brand new shoes. Like, you know, they didn't want to get messed up. It was really hard to get people like, get your hands down in, in this. And then like, remember kids would say like, you all look like a bunch of slaves. Like this is a huge barrier. Here cuz there's not an ability to imagine us working and doing this free labor in any other way.</p>



<p>And like who's in charge, the white guys like, like, yeah, it totally looks, it totally looks that way. So,</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> um, yeah. Yeah. It that's a good, that is a good way to put that. Sorry, that that</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> really story. Cause you can express that in a way that is accusatory. and make, you know, make us feel really bad, but, um, but it's totally valid and, and [00:38:00] there was a disconnect.</p>



<p>And the only way I found around that was like individual relationships and getting like over a couple years and getting to know some of these kids is they were growing up and like they in doing other things with them, like I found a, a bunch of the young men, um, like they never went over to east side.</p>



<p>That's dangerous. You can't go over there and there's nothing there that we would be interested in and, you know, broadening people's sense of their own freedom and capacity. Yeah, you actually, we can go over here. There's some cool stuff and food you like and, um, people who, uh, are friendly. So it, I think that kind of everyone does that everyone has their little comfort zone that probably needs to be expand.</p>



<p>But at the same time, those walls exist, cuz people have been hurt or they've, um, or there's something in their history where they see this as a wall that is defended and is dangerous to push [00:39:00] or they, they sense on some level like this is gonna, um, this isn't what I should, this isn't for me, this isn't my people.</p>



<p>That's just huge that's people stuff. We have to find, find ways to make many ways through and in. Um, cuz if you keep trying something that doesn't work, that turns people off, it doesn't matter how right. You think you are.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh yeah, you're right on the money with that. And. just relating that back to WordPress. Imagine those kids that you were, uh, you know, trying to get to do that with. And they're like, God, like not saying, this is their attitude, but say they walked away with that saying mm-hmm they were trying to get us to do free labor.</p>



<p>They were trying to get us do free work. That's crazy. And then they. um, they, you know, they get older and they learn code and they learn tech. And they've heard that tech is just this, this freedom and it's this place to make money. And it's just like, you can elevate, I can elevate my life and they get to tech.</p>



<p>And the first thing they see is people saying, Hey, if you wanna be a [00:40:00] great person in this community, you need to do some free work. They all like what? Like they might freak out like what in the world? Why is everybody want me to do free, free labor and, um, that's, you know, that's just relating that back.</p>



<p>It's it's sometimes that's. A red flag to people. It's definitely a red flag to me. Um, because also people are still exploiting people of color women. Um, people who are disabled, they are still getting exploited for low wages or free labor to this day. So that's still something we have to look out for.</p>



<p>I've been asked to do free labor many times, and I've had to politely tell people like, no, I'm not doing that. Or, you know, and depending on. What the situation is, maybe talk to others, like what's going on. Like I have to teach my mentors not to accept like, well, this job, they really gonna gimme the experience.</p>



<p>They said, okay, me an exposure and experience. And then one day I'll be a big developer. No. Do not let people do that to you. That's like, I, I always tell people like, no, [00:41:00] you, you deserve to be paid. Now you deserve to be paid fair and adequately. So we don't have to go back too far. It's happening today. Um, so of course people are calling it out more and people are looking at it as a red flag.</p>



<p>I hate that people see it as a red flag in WordPress. Uh, some people. Inmate WordPress and giving back. And then I hate that some people just, you know, don't have the time and they're turned off by, you know, phrasing about it because it's, it's a privilege to have free time. Honestly, these days, isn't it, it's a privilege to be able to give back.</p>



<p>And that's something I never forget. And that's, that's something I always tell people as well, like, you know, you don't have to. You don't have to thank me. Like people are always like, oh, thank you for this like that. I don't, you know, you don't have to thank me. I, I acknowledge that, you know, it's just a privilege for me to be able to do this for you and that throws some people off, but Hey, it knows what it is, but we, I don't know how to bridge that.</p>



<p>Especially as a, as a woman of color, who's been asked to do free things as a woman, as a woman of color, as a [00:42:00] person of color. I get it. I get it. I definitely</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> get. I, I, I was really glad when I, I think it was Josepha my first contact with hearing someone say that it's a privilege to contribute. Um, and I hadn't really thought about that.</p>



<p>Um, that does that's good language, I think, because it, it gives honor to that role and that capacity, but it also understands that that might not be. An individual is at, at that time, then I think you have to extend yourself and go further and, and look at who is underprivileged or who lacks these privileges and how can we raise them up?</p>



<p>How can we open doors? Um, and that that's, what's cool about the mentoring and, and the community stuff. Cause I think that's, that's what it does, you know, get it will help. It will help. There are other ways to, to give back and. [00:43:00] And it's, it can take years it's years of relationships and, and growth where, um, that that's what's needed to happen.</p>



<p>And you can't, you can't what we're saying here. You can't just treat people like cogs. Like they're not all in the same category. They're not the same time of life and they're not the same people. And when you really know, get to know them, um, they've unique gifts and capacities and what they're okay.</p>



<p>Okay. With doing. um, at the moment and it's okay for everyone to say, and they, they, they need to, like, I need to, I need to step back. I need, um, I think we've been, there's been so much more, um, recognition of that. Um, mm-hmm , uh, someone was tweeting the other day of like, they're just too much coming at. 'em too much stress.</p>



<p>They're gonna, they're gonna give their, um, word camp ticket to someone else. And. Step back from going there. And, um, and a lot of people are [00:44:00] really supportive of that. Like, yeah, it's tough. Uh, tough call maybe, but, um, it's okay to it's okay to say, you know, I I've hit my limit here. Um, mm-hmm .</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> That. Yeah, I think so.</p>



<p>I'm gonna backtrack. I think that that's a great way. That would be a, a big help to helping people letting them know it's okay. That needs to be more clear if you can't do this right now. It's okay. Like you said, like, you know, Joseph said it's a privilege and you know, letting these people know, like, um, that doesn't mean you're not privileged if you can't do.</p>



<p>You know, that's just not your time and that's, and that's completely okay. Right. And I, I like that. I like that a lot. And I, I really like that. I think also another big thing. We need to get people to see the value mm-hmm and giving back. Because again, like what's the value. If I can't make money, if I have to like take time out of my life where I'm missing with my family or my friends, what's the, what value do I have to, some people like, just knowing it's going to [00:45:00] improve the life of someone else is not enough.</p>



<p>it's okay though. It's okay. Um, but how do we get people to see the value in this? I think community seeing people like me, who, you know, I could not, I could stop giving back tomorrow and be okay and go do other things with my life. But I don't wanna do that. I like giving back. It's valuable to. . I have a lot of things I value about giving back, especially in this community.</p>



<p>And if I stand up there and I talk about it and I tell people and I give to them, honestly, I think that's the number one thing I've seen in my life that makes other people wanna give. If they can see the value that other people are getting, that isn't tangible, nobody's handing me money to do any of this.</p>



<p>so I think being a, a beacon of that helps, and I think I wish we had more people, but it's, it's hard if you're, if you're doing all of this and you're giving your time away, it's hard to be like, you know, the poster job for that as well. Um, right. We a lot of people have families. I don't know what I would do if I had children.</p>



<p>I think I would probably just [00:46:00] scrap 'em to my chest. One of those little baby vests. I like those. Yeah. I used to do that in front of you. Yeah. Oh, I love those. I would just scrap 'em to my chest and like, I guess we</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> around and talk. I'm glad to be through that kind of, um, yeah, my, my younger two daughters are, um, on finishing high school now, so it's pretty.</p>



<p>It's on their own, but, uh, yeah, that was, that was tough. That was interesting. I was the home parent. Um, and at one point, yeah, they were like, mm-hmm um, four girls they were mostly there with me and yeah, the two close together. Um, yeah. It's uh, well freelancing and doing neighborhood projects. It, it was, um, it was a lot and yeah.</p>



<p>And mm-hmm it makes you, it makes you sensitive. the fact that you need to, you need to understand people in their context and so that, like you don't mm-hmm so you can kind of help on your end too. You don't ask too much or that, you know, you know, how to, [00:47:00] how to phrase, um, you know what they're, they're just some conditions like you understand like, oh, this is, isn't a good, this isn't a good time or a good person to, to ask to, to help with this.</p>



<p>Or. Or maybe they need, you know, just knowing what the needs are and where you can be supportive to. Um, yeah, just the, the more you get deeper into individual relationships, I think the stronger and more, um, sensitive like community is the, like those go together, the strong and sensitive . Cause you're, you're aware of each other as individuals and, um, that holds things nice.</p>



<p>Yeah, that made me, I was one. The last thing I, I was thinking while you were saying that there, there are so many, I think there are so many things people do or don't do that. Some things need to not be done. that, that contribute so [00:48:00] much. And we know it and, and sometimes it there's other forms of recognition that are important.</p>



<p>Like yeah. If the, if WordPress cord doesn't move forward, everything else fails. And there's like, there's a level. um, mm-hmm of focus and need on that, that that is is unique, but then there's stuff that's farfield from maybe any, any teams that is so important in the ecosystem. And, um, uh, a guy, everyone I think has nothing but prays for it.</p>



<p>Kevin O Hashi who, um, who like Kevin O Hashi, who does the, um, uh, WordPress benchmarks? WooCommerce too. Have you ever looked at those? Uh, there's kind of neutral third party deep, um, uh, analysis each year of, um, performance on load testing and, and a bunch of other stuff of, of hosts. Who, who, um, partner with them who say like, yeah, here here's our, here's a free account [00:49:00] and all of our tiers test them.</p>



<p>Um, never go through those and, and see.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I have, um, I have, did I do last year? I have, I have, I I'm like, I'm just going back in my mind, but I have, and I think that is really, really, really awesome. That does that. I'm so sorry. I hear</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> from people a lot about, about that. Like that's a, that's a major service because there there's a lot of data poverty in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>



<p>If your plugin isn't in the re.org repo, like what do we know? What, what, what do you, what do we know about that whole, um, part of the market? And if you are in it, it's very limited. What, what data you get out, um, hosting, you know, going way back has always been. A pretty murky place for are these real reviews?</p>



<p>No, Jen . Oh man. So this is like the [00:50:00] one he's got the one, um, the one shining beacon of reliable, trustworthy stuff. And as, uh, And he, the contribution is largely in what he doesn't do, which is take money or sponsors in. Um, I, I forget what is, what the, what the revenue model there is, but this is, this is one guy.</p>



<p>Um, this isn't some growth oper organization. Um, it, those are really difficult things. The things we need to subsidize or help that, um, are. Kind of have a regulatory effect that help protect the space and the commons, um, because they don't aim at massive growth and they aim at a giving you a really honest signal on, um, you know, how are, how are these hosts doing one, one compared to another, what do you get for this, [00:51:00] this price point?</p>



<p>And. They, um, it's good for them. They, they know where they stand and how they're, how they're doing. I'm sure they have their own data, but it's a huge incentive to, um, to compete where we want them to . Um, there's a lot, there's a lot of different things like that. There's just certain personalities who give back a ton on, um, social media or in, um, their willingness to, to teach others.</p>



<p>Um, but. Yeah, I don't know. Do we recognize that openly enough? Um, and I think people doing stuff for the love of it is a huge privilege and it really, it is really is gratifying when people say thank you. So, um, we should do that more and thank you for starting meetups. Interesting. coming on this, on this podcast and, and being a, um, a unique voice in the, in the C.[00:52:00]</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Uh, you're so welcome. Thank you, Dan, for having me on here and agreeing to do a</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> no, I didn't agree to that. depends on what it is, but yeah, I'm looking, looking forward to meeting all there.</p>

<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I'll give you a list. I'll give you a.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> God love. Uh, yeah. I don't know nothing by Madonna. I remember bad memories of a friend at a, um, student union at Marquette university who, uh, crazy guy. I don't think he had even been drinking, but he did, um, Papa don't preach and acted it out.</p>



<p>Oh, he ended up playing down on a table or something and yeah. Yeah. He was having a, having his baby. Um,</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> oh, now I gotta do [00:53:00] Madonna. I gotta show him up. okay. No Madonna just make me a list of no, the nose. No Madonna. Okay. I have that. I'll</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> write that down. probably, and Tom waits. I love Madonna. Tom waits. Some.</p>

<h2><em>&#8220;Is this a WordPress acquisition?&#8221;</em> </h2>



<p class="has-drop-cap">That question <a href="https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/CHNM7Q7T8/p1661260463302889">led to some discussion</a> in <strong>Post Status Slack</strong> this week. The consensus was ‚Äúyes it is,‚Äù although we‚Äôve certainly included many WordPress-adjacent or partnered companies on our (updated) <a href="https://poststatus.com/acquisitions/">Acquisitions</a> page. The <a href="https://investors.digitalocean.com/news/news-details/2022/DigitalOcean-to-Acquire-Cloudways/default.aspx">number-filled announcement to investors</a> and <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/619704647/files/doc_downloads/2022/DigitalOcean-Cloudways-Acquisition-Infographic.pdf">infographic</a> from <strong>DigitalOcean</strong> make it clear they know they are buying (or rather getting deeper) into the WordPress ecosystem by acquiring <strong>Cloudways</strong>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>‚ÄúThe acquisition of Cloudways expands DigitalOcean‚Äôs serviceable market within global SMBs and increases options for <strong>digital agencies, eCommerce sites, bloggers, freelance developers and builders hosting on WordPress</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>Magento</strong>. WordPress is the most popular content management system (CMS) and, according to <strong>W3Techs</strong>, it powers 43% of all websites on the internet.‚Äù</p><cite>&#8220;DigitalOcean to Acquire Cloudways&#8221; ‚Ä¢ bold text added for <strong>emphasis</strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>DigitalOcean is embracing its role as a WordPress host and pivoting to define its market as, well, <em>us</em>. The bold text above highlights a large part of our membership and the WordPress community.</p>



<h3><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Big emphasis on SMBs.</strong> DigitalOcean sees itself expanding to gain small-to-mid-sized businesses (SMBs) in its customer demographic, and acquiring Cloudways with its WordPress and other open source eCommerce customers achieves that.</li><li><strong>Cloudways fills a big gap.</strong> There‚Äôs no easy button within DigitalOcean itself for setting up a WordPress site or anything else, but their 1-click apps are the latest progression toward something like that. It‚Äôs just not likely to appeal to most people in the low-end market <a href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/wordpress?utm_campaign=amer_brand_kw_en_cpc&utm_adgroup=digitalocean_wordpress_bmm&_keyword=digitalocean%20wordpress&_device=c&_adposition=&utm_content=conversion&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5yYBhAjEiwAKXk_eCTLbvWw706hdVQiD8CFN5sup_3G_RMowCw_QPCtG5icj3v7gGg7ORoC4ukQAvD_BwE">in its current state</a>. DigitalOcean marketing is still locked onto startups and developers too. I imagine all this will change if Cloudways is brought in as a SMB customer-facing easy-button.</li><li><strong>New Competition.</strong> Focusing on less-technical end users and the people who build their sites will put DigitalOcean in direct competition with other WordPress-focused Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers or hosting panel middleware like <strong>ServerPilot</strong> ‚Äî which only works with DigitalOcean ‚Äî and <strong>SpinupWP</strong>. Even more so than Cloudways, SpinupWP is host-agnostic ‚Äî any server with a public IP and (currently) <strong>Ubuntu</strong> 20.04 or 22.04 will work with SpinupWP.</li><li><strong>Will DigitalOcean drop Cloudways‚Äô support for competitors?</strong> In addition to DigitalOcean, Cloudways can be used with <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>Vultr</strong>, and <strong>Linode</strong>. Many of us wonder if that flexibility might go away now. If it does, that‚Äôs a wasted opportunity. Post Status Member <strong>Kevin Ohashi</strong> optimistically (and I hope rightly) <a href="https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C1WDQ9W05/p1661371977299379?thread_ts=1661260653.084159&cid=C1WDQ9W05">opined nothing will be changed</a>: ‚ÄúIf the customer isn't going to choose you, might as well still make money off them.‚Äù</li><li><strong>The terms ‚ÄúBuild‚Äù and ‚ÄúBuilder‚Äù are a large part of DigitalOcean‚Äôs messaging</strong> about the acquisition. In fact, the company‚Äôs mission is defined this way, in the context of the acquisition news release: ‚ÄúDigitalOcean simplifies cloud computing so builders can spend more time creating software that changes the world.‚Äù This sounds a lot like WordPress‚Äôs mission updated for the era of (increasingly low/no-code) website builders (the software and the people). It‚Äôs also rather different from DigitalOcean‚Äôs main public-facing messaging which is still focused on startups and developers.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Some interesting numbers from DigitalOcean:</strong></h3>

<p class="has-drop-cap">I've been delinquent with posting on my .blog blog on WordPress.com for about a year, so when I bought into the Pro plan after the first recent price change the new stuff really stood out. I'm also pleased I upgraded then, because after they reverted to the  original price structure I realized I'm getting every feature of the old and new Business plan at about half the current price, although the storage is much lower. </p>



<p>I've dug in a little more since then, and this is clearly the best WP.com so far. Apart from some P2 demo sites, I've never had much going on there. I have a second work account for &#8220;self-hosted&#8221; sites that use Jetpack, and it's still annoying to switch between them and manage subscriptions to comments and posts. You can only be longed into one .com identity at a time, and there's no way to sharing access with team members or clients except as admins of individual sites.</p>



<p>The most surprising thing to see develop over the last six months or so is access to premium plugins ‚Äî including Elementor and the Classic Editor, which are among the 36 &#8220;top premium plugins&#8221; listed. If you dig into the functional categories of plugins you can install, there are thousands. (I'd love to know how these are being selected, or if all plugins in the .org repo are automatically included.)</p>



<p>I haven't explored how I'd go about adding &#8220;third party code&#8221; or installing any of the 50,000+ plugins in the .org repo, but that's allowed on my &#8220;Pro&#8221; plan. </p>



<p>I can see it would be relatively easy to set up a Substack-like site at WP.com because I know the plugins you'd need, but for the average user they'd really have to dig into some docs and do the work of educating themselves. What's badly needed are something like &#8220;blueprints&#8221; for instantly installing typical configurations of plugins and themes for a common use-case. </p>



<p>Several years ago I mapped out how I would strip down WordPress and turn it into a Substack-like membership site that used wp_mail / php_mail properly to see if I could get good deliverability with 100+ subscribers. (This is not a huge feat but a good exercise to get habituated to proper webmail/email practices that are mostly ignored, abused, or outsources as a problem for Mailgun, Mandrill, etc.) I should still do it, if I ever get the time, but it's cool to see a fully Open Source and better-than-Substack site becoming possible (and maybe preferable) at WordPress.com.</p>

<p>Sharma's article is not a hit piece on open source, however. She notes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The open-source community is aware of its security problem. In fact, the community is already attempting to build out institutions and standards to secure open source. For example, the Open Source Security Foundation, or <a href="https://openssf.org/">OpenSSF</a>, has already met with the White House twice and has 10 dedicated workstreams all focused on securing the open-source ecosystem. Companies like Microsoft and Google, large open-source contributors, have pledged <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/16/white-house-open-source-security/">$30 million</a> to support OpenSSF‚Äôs efforts. The <a href="https://ostif.org/">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</a> (OSTIF) was founded recently to provide free security auditing services to open-source projects and continues to grow.<br /><br /><em>However, on its own, the open-source community does not have the leverage to demand the resources and minimum security practices required. To preserve its core ethos as a free service and commodity, the open-source community cannot impose conditional requirements on its projects. As a collaborative of many volunteer developers, it also struggles to impose requirements on its own contributors.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>



<p>I wonder if that is really true and open source self-regulation is truly impossible. Sharma uses developer pushback as an example, in the case of the <strong>Python Package Index</strong> (PyPI) imposing &#8220;minimum security measures on &#8216;critical' projects.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her argument is that open source needs help and governments should pitch in because open source software is ‚Äúcritical infrastructure.‚Äù This is not a new idea:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Several nations have adopted regulations that recognize open-source projects as significant public assets and central to their most important systems and services. <a href="https://sciencebusiness.net/news/germany-launch-sovereign-tech-fund-secure-digital-infrastructure">Germany</a> wants to treat open-source software as a public good and launched a sovereign tech fund to support open-source projects ‚Äújust as much as bridges and roads,‚Äù and not just when a bridge collapses.

This includes smaller related items like the shim for non-supporting browsers and adding PDF  support, which are being handled in separate tickets.</p>



<p>The proposal to generate WebP images by default for new JPEG image uploads has been controversial from the beginning. While the Google-sponsored contributors driving the project have made some revisions after an initial round of significant critical feedback, other contributors have continued to voice concerns that they said were not being considered. Several contributors reported issues with the feature and suggested that it should start by being opt-in, an idea that was summarily dismissed before the main work was committed.</p>



<p>Last week, WordPress lead developer Andrew Ozz weighed in on the ticket with <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:112">new objections</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Like&nbsp;<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/MatthiasReinholz">@MatthiasReinholz</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/eatingrules">@eatingrules</a>, and others I think this approach is perhaps lacking. Why would there be twice as many image files taking up a lot of extra space when half of them will never ever be used anywhere?</p>



<p>IMHO a better approach would be to just make all image sub-sizes WEBP. If JPEGs are indeed needed, these can be generated on-the-fly as needed. There is no point of clogging the web servers storage with all these useless files.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if the WEBP file sizes are actually larger than the JPEGs, that would probably mean that better tools are needed, and this patch is premature.</p>



<p></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Six weeks ago, in response to one complaint that the &#8220;resources for conversion would be tremendous,&#8221; Google-sponsored core committer Adam Silverstein confirmed that resources for generating the images on upload would &#8220;increase dramatically.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;However resources to serve an image will be lowered,&#8221; Silverstein said. &#8220;Since image uploading is very rare compared to image serving, the extra effort to compress and store images should be worth it.&#8221;</p>



<p>This is another problem Ozz cited in his objection to this approach.</p>



<p>&#8220;Actually that dramatic increase of resources usage when uploading an image is a very bad side effect here,&#8221; Ozz said. &#8220;It means a lot of uploads will fail, and leave the users stranded. It also will increase support requests for both WordPress and the hosting companies dramatically. Don&#8217;t think this is acceptable. Because of this, even if image multi-mime support is needed in WordPress, the current approach doesn&#8217;t seem like a good solution.&#8221;</p>



<p>Approximately 24 hours later, Google-sponsored contributor Felix Arntz <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:114">commented</a> to advise that the WebP fallback mechanism to JPEG for older browsers was ready for commit and that he planned to commit it in a few days.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please do not commit any more code here unless it is to address the dramatic increase of resources needed to create image sub-sizes after upload,&#8221; Ozz said. &#8220;As I said above such increase is unacceptable.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is there any data about how much more resources (memory, processing time, etc.) are needed when uploading different image sizes? Any estimate about how many sites may be affected by that? Any suggestions on how to deal with it? Do you know what happens when post-processing of an uploaded image fails?</p>



<p>&#8220;Frankly for now it seems that this patch will have to be reverted and refactored in order to address this.&#8221;</p>



<p>Adam Silverstein responded to his concerns with clarification on why they chose the current approach, in anticipation of certain edge cases and eventually adding support for formats like AVIF once it is more widely supported:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I tend to agree with your assessment that all sub-sizes should be generated as WebP only, that was the shape of the original proposal. For the vast majority of use cases/users this will work the best. I would be open to considering this for the default (with some mitigations, see below).</p>



<p>The reason we decided to generate both formats was for backwards compatibility considerations for the few edge cases we identified where WebP images will might not work: namely emailed images (some older outlook/windows clients), Open Graph tags (some services don&#8217;t support WebP) and older Safari browsers. One possibility we considered would be to keep only the full sized JPEG so it is always available for those edge cases.</p>



<p>The &#8220;multi-mime&#8221; support here is built to generating multiple formats so you sites can provide a primary and fallback format with something like the¬†<code>picture</code>¬†element. This is less important for WebP since it is so widely supported, but would be helpful for adopting newer formats like AVIF by plugins or core.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Silverstein also said the option of generating images on the fly was something they need to figure out but &#8220;felt out of scope for this effort.&#8221;</p>



<p>In response to the complaint regarding the dramatic increase in resources for image uploads, Silverstein said they are relying on the &#8220;retry&#8221; mechanism to mitigate this problem.</p>



<p>&#8220;This change also doubles the number of times WordPress will retry&#8217; the image regeneration, so while processing time will increase, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see a jump in failures necessarily,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know we had trouble adding new sizes in the past, however that was before we added the retry mechanism.&#8221;</p>



<p>The team behind the WebP by default project is more focused on serving smaller image sizes on the frontend and considers the additional resource usage on upload a necessary sacrifice for WordPress users.</p>



<p>&#8220;The additional resources at upload time needs to be weighed against the reduced resources of serving the smaller WebP image, especially since serving typically occurs several orders of magnitude more frequently than uploading,&#8221; Silverstein said.</p>



<p>&#8220;If uploading fails after all the retries, the user has the same experience as currently: they are left with a broken, unusable image. That can probably be fixed, although I don&#8217;t think this change will increases failure rates.&#8221;</p>



<p>WordPress lead developer Dion Hulse also <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:123">commented</a> on the ticket to report issues with WebP conversions in the WordPress Photo Directory:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Just noting here, that these additional webp conversions appear to have been the leading cause of upload failures on the WordPress Photo Directory in recent weeks. See&nbsp;<a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org//intertrac/ticket%3A6142">#meta6142</a>&nbsp;and tickets closed as duplicate of it.</p>



<p>The errors were generally along the lines of&nbsp;<code>Allowed memory size of 256M bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 90M bytes</code>&nbsp;(obviously with byte values) while attempting to perform the initial full-size-original jpeg -&gt; webp conversion.</p>



<p>It hasn&#8217;t affected&nbsp;<em>every upload</em>, only that of certain images. Potentially related to the&nbsp;<code>$quality</code>&nbsp;value being passed for webp requests (IIRC the default of 82 was optimized for jpeg?).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hulse <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12023">disabled the JPEG to WebP conversion</a> as a result of these errors, as the photo directory doesn&#8217;t currently use WebP but noted that it &#8220;might be a sign that it might be worth considering only generating webp&#8217;s for the resized images, rather than for the original file too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Silverstein said they are investigating the issues Hulse reported, as it may have exposed a bug.</p>



<p>Ozz circled back to <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:126">recommend</a> that making sub-sizes on demand would be a better approach that has faster processing of uploaded images and reduced space requirements, since the additional JPEG images would not be generated unless needed. He also noted that the &#8220;retry&#8221; for image post-processing &#8220;doesn&#8217;t work as well as expected.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The bad news is that if the post processing fails, chances are the originally uploaded file will remain,&#8221; Ozz said. &#8220;Then it will be used everywhere as most of the code in WP falls back to available sizes, and the only size will be the original. That means we will be serving huge (4MB &#8211; 8MB average) images. A serious drawback.&#8221;</p>



<p>Silverstein responded to Ozz&#8217;s suggestions, agreeing with many, and proposed two potential paths forward for the project: </p>

<p>So on the podcast today we have Andrew Palmer. Andrew has been in the WordPress space for many years as a product owner and open source advocate. He founded and later sold Elegant Marketplace, and more recently is the co-founder of bertha.ai, which is a WordPress plugin, which assists you in creating content directly in the WordPress admin.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve not played with AI, then you might be surprised by how good it&#8217;s becoming. A few years ago, anything written by a computer would be easy to distinguish from that of a human. These boundaries are becoming blurred, as systems like GPT-3 have become remarkably adept at rapidly creating content which is useful and competent.</p>



<p>Many SaaS products have come to the market which enabled you to create AI content by seeding it with a small amount of information. Andrew&#8217;s product is a little different because it allows you to create that content within the WordPress editor and a raft of page builders.</p>



<p>We get into how you can create AI content and when it&#8217;s suitable to do so. Can you rely on the text that&#8217;s created and handover complete editorial control to the plugin.? Or does the generated content still need human intervention?</p>



<p>We also dig into some of the aspects of AI which have people concerned. Are we going to become too reliant on AI tools and will they put copywriters out of work? Will people create content simply to swamp the search engines and make it harder for truly important information to rise to the top.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot of functionality in the plugin, and Andrew tells us some of the possible scenarios where he feels it works best. Creating titles, longer form text, and even sprinkling in a little sarcasm here and there.</p>



<p>Typically when we record the podcast, there&#8217;s not a lot of background noise, but that&#8217;s not always the case with these WordCamp Europe interviews. We were competing against crowds and the air conditioning. And whilst the podcasts are more than listable, I hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world where at play.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. And you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes there as well. And so without further delay, I bring you Andrew Palmer.</p>



<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Andrew Palmer. How are you doing Andrew?</p>



<p>[00:04:02] Andrew Palmer: I&#8217;m very good. Nathan. Thanks very much for inviting me on.</p>



<p>[00:04:04] Nathan Wrigley: We are in the bowels of the Super Bock Arena and let&#8217;s be honest, it was a challenge finding this room, wasn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p>[00:04:10] Andrew Palmer: It was, and especially as I was running late and you&#8217;ve been very kind to still accommodate me, thank you.</p>



<p>[00:04:15] Nathan Wrigley: You are, most welcome. Andrew&#8217;s been in the WordPress community for years and years and years, but it&#8217;s not been always on the up and up has it? You&#8217;ve had your moments where you&#8217;ve stepped away for a little while and now you&#8217;ve reemerged. Is that true? Is that fair to say?</p>



<p>[00:04:28] Andrew Palmer: Kind of, I mean, I sold Elegant Marketplace to the wonderful people that InMotion Hosting. So that enabled me to go off and play golf for a little while, and invest in other businesses and interests.</p>



<p>[00:04:39] Nathan Wrigley: Do you think this is for you, you know, a moment of excitement or are you still with tentative steps?</p>



<p>[00:04:46] Andrew Palmer: It could be construed as a resurgence. I mean, I&#8217;ve always connected with the WordPress community, cuz we&#8217;re such a friendly bunch. I had an opportunity to develop plugins and be a product maker, and I took over a lot of products from a very good friend of mine and hopefully we&#8217;ve enhanced them and made them better.</p>



<p>[00:05:04] Nathan Wrigley: You&#8217;ve listed a, a few of the things that you&#8217;ve been involved in, but you&#8217;ve obviously been involved in lots of different businesses. Do you think with 50,000 plus plugins in the WordPress repository, countless commercial plugins, are we in a saturated marketplace? What I mean by that is if you are creating a new product, is it very difficult to be discovered? Is discoverability really difficult? Okay, let&#8217;s take two scenarios. The first one you&#8217;ve got a budget to advertise. And the second one is if you have to bootstrap it and do more or less all of it yourself. So two parts.</p>



<p>[00:05:36] Andrew Palmer: You know, if you&#8217;re gonna do jerk sauce it&#8217;s still hard. You know, you&#8217;ve got supermarkets, they do their own brand as well. As soon as a brand new hot sauce comes out, the supermarkets go, oh, we&#8217;ve got our own version of this, and they charge you a few hundred thousand pounds to be put on the supermarket shelves. So, there&#8217;s always a price to pay isn&#8217;t it, it&#8217;s a pay to play arena in every single business aspect. So the benefit that we have in WordPress is that we can throw something onto WordPress dot org, which is great.</p>



<p>I mean, throw is maybe not the right word because it does go through a, a little bit of moderation, one would hope, but, um, you know, you can throw out a free version of what you&#8217;ve got and test the market. That&#8217;s really cool because, you throw out an MVP and people then like it and you then put some pro versions together or pro bits and pieces and say, okay, yeah, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m willing to pay 10 30, 50, a hundred bucks for that a month or a year or whatever.</p>



<p>So the competitive landscape of every business in the world is competitive by nature, because there are so many products out there that are similar. There&#8217;s loads of light bulbs out there. It&#8217;s not just Phillips. Loads of CDs, you know, it&#8217;s just not Phillips. So you gotta make your own way, I think.</p>



<p>[00:06:51] Nathan Wrigley: With the whole plugin thing and the whole of saturation thing, you&#8217;ve launched several products over the course of your career. Most recently, maybe there&#8217;s something after this, but I think the most recent one is Bertha.ai. That&#8217;s actually the URL as well as the name of the product I think.</p>



<p>[00:07:07] Andrew Palmer: It is Bertha.ai. It&#8217;s uh, my very good friend and, uh, co-founder Vito Peleg phoned me far too early in the morning, because he gets up at five o&#8217;clock and said, hey, I got an idea, man, let&#8217;s do it. We did and financial situations, I&#8217;m the, you know, I&#8217;m the guy that&#8217;s got the cash and we invested in it and Vito invested, blood, sweat and tears as we all did. And I&#8217;ve got a development team, you know, and they worked really, really hard and we launched it at the end of September, 2021. It&#8217;s going well.</p>



<p>[00:07:37] Nathan Wrigley: Is that the primary reason that you are here at WordCamp EU? Actually just rewind that a little bit. When the tickets were announced, I think you were the first person that I know who committed to coming. You probably weren&#8217;t the first person that bought a ticket, but in my social network, you were the first person who said, oh, I&#8217;ve done it. I&#8217;ve bought a plane ticket. I&#8217;ve got the hotel and blah, blah, blah. You must be fairly committed to these kind of events. And if that&#8217;s the case, what&#8217;s the thing? What&#8217;s the angle. Is it the community? Is it a bit of community, a bit of networking, a bit of marketing?</p>



<p>[00:08:06] Andrew Palmer: It&#8217;s a lot about the community because, uh, I&#8217;m looking for developers, you know, so I need to chat to people and meet with people. And we are very lucky yesterday and got treated to a gin fest, by Codeable. Marcel who actually works in, for Codeable rather, in Portugal, did an event for Codeable and invited us all along.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s all about networking, and we met a few, I met a few coders and had a good old chat, and that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about. It&#8217;s me networking. Supporting the community, as much as I possibly can, being a bootstrap business. It&#8217;s quite expensive developing a plugin and there&#8217;s lots of things you have to commit to like getting a new CMO, you know, in Stephanie Hudson. She&#8217;s got her own business to run and, and we&#8217;re all kind of bootstrap minded.</p>



<p>So we all have to do little things and Vito&#8217;s got Atarim to do so he&#8217;s gonna concentrate more on that now. So, you know, I needed a sidekick. Stephanie&#8217;s that sidekick, who&#8217;s got the strategy and the marketing nouse and she&#8217;s also based in the U.S. Which is good. And Bertha is now incorporated in the U.S. as well. So it&#8217;s all. Moving along swiftly, but I did actually release a GDPR plugin last week.</p>



<p>So GDPR friendly fonts, but it&#8217;s a commercial one. There&#8217;s a few free ones out there, but ours is good. So, launching things all the time and improving the plugins and making sure that we are in touch with what people in the community actually want, because we are here. Plugins, I think are more here to support the developer than the, than the end client. To give them an easier way to market if you like, or an easier or quicker, faster speedier way to get their product out, whether it&#8217;s, uh, an MVP for themselves or whether it&#8217;s a website for a direct client .</p>



<p>Plugins and extensions and themes. And you know, what Gutenberg Hub doing with Gutenberg? What Extendify are doing with Gutenberg is quite amazing and all the form plugins out there, you know, we&#8217;ve got, I&#8217;ve got very good friend Mark Westguard who&#8217;s does WS Form. It happens to be my favorite form. We happen to get on, which is really cool. So it&#8217;s about meeting these people. Coming together in Europe, biggest WordCamp in the world. You know, pretty good.</p>



<p>[00:10:15] Nathan Wrigley: Do you have a battle plan though? Do you have, before you set off. I was wondering, because you said earlier you wanted to meet developers and today was contributor day.</p>



<p>[00:10:22] Andrew Palmer: I couldn&#8217;t get in.</p>



<p>[00:10:23] Nathan Wrigley: Was it just because you were a bit late?</p>



<p>[00:10:25] Andrew Palmer: No, I was a contributor, I was just late. I just kind of thought, well, do you know what? And Stephanie runs the Focus WP Facebook group. So we had a little meet up and we&#8217;ve gone out on the town and just met with a few people from the Focus Facebook group as well. So there&#8217;s always networking opportunities. There&#8217;s nothing else to do a WordCamp than have a great look at Porto, which is probably one of the best venues you could choose.</p>



<p>Food&#8217;s cheap, and good. The weather has turned out to be better than we thought it would be. There&#8217;s a little spits and spots of rain, but effectively Porto&#8217;s a great historical town as So, you know, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a bit of a vacation stroke job bit.</p>



<p>[00:11:04] Nathan Wrigley: You said that you were in search of developers and the bit was gonna develop there was, so there was 500 odd today and it felt busy. Tomorrow, maybe more like, touching 3000. So it&#8217;s gonna be really busy. And if you haven&#8217;t got a, I don&#8217;t know, an agenda and a meeting list, do you literally just try to work out who in the room is a developer by just going up and talking?</p>



<p>[00:11:26] Andrew Palmer: Well, I&#8217;m gonna be standing on a booth as well for an hour or so. And I&#8217;m also going to, I&#8217;ve got a few meetings scheduled, which is pretty cool. With developers as well as, you know, funders and people like that who are interested in either investing in Bertha or doing some partnerships with Bertha and stuff like that. Because once you&#8217;ve got a plugin that kind of answers all the questions with copywriting within WordPress, people want to talk to you, which is really cool.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s a long day, Nathan, you know, it&#8217;s a very long day and it goes into the evening. I&#8217;m gonna have opportunities to meet and chat with people all the time. I&#8217;ve got tons of Twitter messages to answer, and stuff like that. You know what it&#8217;s like.</p>



<p>[00:12:02] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m struggling keep up with the different platforms. This person is over here on Slack, this person is over here on Twitter. Yeah it can be difficult. So let&#8217;s talk about your, well, I&#8217;m guessing the booth tomorrow is Bertha.</p>



<p>[00:12:13] Andrew Palmer: No, the booth I&#8217;m gonna be helping out Atarim, because Vito&#8217;s a very good friend of mine and I know Atarim pretty well. I&#8217;ve used it from the very, very beginning, and now it&#8217;s on version three. It&#8217;s their third birthday. And Vito likes to run around. You can&#8217;t really keep him to a spot. There&#8217;s a bit of super glue we&#8217;ve snuck in there. But Alex Panagis, he&#8217;s gonna be on the booth as well, and I&#8217;ll be hanging around and just answering some questions that people don&#8217;t really get it or something.</p>



<p>So, you know, it&#8217;s so dual role. But of course Bertha&#8217;s gonna be mentioned in the conversations. Well, because that was actually the idea, is that Vito wanted an AI to be able to write within the note making facility, you know, you put these little notes on websites. So our first job was to make Bertha work in the front end of Atarim. And it does. So you can now, so customers can now say, right, I want this headline and then ask Bertha to generate an option for headlines and they&#8217;ll put it in. I want this paragraph here and all that kind of stuff, and Bertha can do that within Atarim.</p>



<p>[00:13:10] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. I feel at this point, we should explain because we&#8217;ve stepped ahead. So okay, Bertha is a plugin for WordPress, which enables you to create AI content. So that could be any form of content. It&#8217;s just text, right?</p>



<p>[00:13:23] Andrew Palmer: Yeah, I think the best way to describe Bertha is that she is an AI copywriting assistant. So you are the editor, she&#8217;s the journalist that&#8217;s gone out and found the stories and the facts and the general content, and you working as the editor within WordPress, then edit that content and make it your own. And that&#8217;s the best way to describe Bertha. She&#8217;s not just a machine that says, right, write me a blog about this. We&#8217;ve got three things coming next week for the pro version. And one of them is very, very long form where you just give her a hint and she will write it for you. And then you just edit that.</p>



<p>[00:13:58] Nathan Wrigley: All right, let&#8217;s build up the jigsaw of how it all works. So we install the plugin, all of that normal stuff. How do we seed Bertha with the idea? So for example, let&#8217;s say that we want to write a blog post about WordCamp Europe. How do we seed the idea into Bertha, and how much do we need to seed in, in order to get something decent back? Let&#8217;s go with a title first, just the title.</p>



<p>[00:14:19] Andrew Palmer: Okay. Title you just say, what do I want to write about? So you just write, what do I wanna write about, I wanna write about blog posts being written by AI. And then say generate a headline around that. And Bertha will give you four alternatives, or two alternatives or three, depending on how good your one was, and you click and that&#8217;s, that then goes into the text bit.</p>



<p>Then you say, right, okay, I&#8217;m writing a blog post about this. So I&#8217;m gonna go to the blog post topic ideas model, and I&#8217;m going to give it the title and then, or going to give Bertha the title and then you press generate text and Bertha will come up with one to four or one to five blog post topic ideas. And then you put number one in as the title in a paragraph generator, and that will generate your paragraphs around that first topic idea. And then you just go through. It&#8217;s of a workflow that you get into.</p>



<p>[00:15:07] Nathan Wrigley: People listening to this, they&#8217;re gonna think, okay, this is voodoo. How does this work? How does it work?</p>



<p>[00:15:13] Andrew Palmer: Well we&#8217;re very open about how it&#8217;s done. It&#8217;s it is open AI dot com, and we&#8217;ve written our own models. And we now use the latest version of GPT-3, which is really fast and uses things called suffixes and prefixes. And it writes much, much better quality AI generated content. And it has the previous GPT, DaVinci was up to, I think, uh, 1999 or whatever it was. It was ages ago. It scraped 10% of the web to get the ideas for the content.</p>



<p>This one is now 2021. June 2021. So much more recent content. If you wanna write about crypto, if you wanna write about FinTech or modern FinTech or anything that&#8217;s going on in the modern world. COVID for instance, you wanna write about that or the history of COVID from 1990, whenever it was. I can&#8217;t remember the dates COVID&#8217;s done my head in. It will write that history for you now. So it&#8217;s much better, much quicker, faster, better quality and, easier use.</p>



<p>[00:16:16] Nathan Wrigley: People who&#8217;ve never used these tools before, they might have sort of concerns about a, does it scan, does it even read like a human wrote it.</p>



<p>[00:16:24] Andrew Palmer: Oh, for sure it does, yeah.</p>



<p>[00:16:25] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So you can be pretty confident that it&#8217;s gonna scan well. But in terms of the quality, where do you stand on how much supervision. Is it like an aberrant child? Do you need to go back to it and give it some love and attention? Or is this a case of, I am just gonna press the button, not read, publish. There&#8217;s probably a bit of a spectrum, but how much of you come to trust it to be left to its own devices? Or how much do you go back through and read everything that it generated?</p>



<p>[00:16:52] Andrew Palmer: Well, when you are writing, you&#8217;re thinking about what you&#8217;re writing and Bertha does exactly the same thing. Doesn&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s gonna write a paragraph ahead. Just like I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m gonna say 10 seconds ahead. But I&#8217;m forming the words in my head and then they come outta my mouth and whatever. And I will make a few missteps.</p>



<p>We know politicians make missteps all the time, cause they, maybe they don&#8217;t engage brain before whatever, but, you have to be the editor. What I don&#8217;t want Bertha to be is a total AI copywriting situation. Just write everything for you, because that&#8217;s not fair on you as a producer of content, it&#8217;s not fair on your readers and it will eventually work against you because your content will become repetitive.</p>



<p>It will become not unique. You won&#8217;t have your tone of voice necessarily. So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s up to you, which AI generator you want to use. If you&#8217;re gonna be a spammer, then use the others. If you&#8217;re gonna, gonna really invest in your copy, but with the help of an AI, Bertha&#8217;s the way to go.</p>



<p>[00:17:57] Nathan Wrigley: So would it be fair to categorize if you&#8217;re gonna do longish form, it&#8217;s a launchpad. You click the button and there&#8217;s an idea here&#8217;s where you could go. Not necessarily, there&#8217;s the finished product. It&#8217;s a bit like a junior journalist would hand to an editor and say, I think that this is the finished product.</p>



<p>[00:18:15] Andrew Palmer: Exactly.</p>



<p>[00:18:15] Nathan Wrigley: Is that where we&#8217;re at? You should generate this content, then look at it yourself on every occasion because the AI, right where we are now is not quite to be trusted.</p>



<p>[00:18:25] Andrew Palmer: Well, yeah, just exactly like Tesla. They do an auto drive. It&#8217;s definitely not to be trusted. I was in one a few weeks ago on my travels in the States and all of a sudden we turned left into a bunch of roadworks, well what&#8217;s that about?</p>



<p>Luckily, the driver was supervising quite well, but you know, you can&#8217;t trust AI completely. And I don&#8217;t think you ever should. There should always be some human interaction. That&#8217;s what I believe in that. My aim is with website production is to make it quicker, better, faster.</p>



<p>[00:18:55] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. Yeah. And it helps with those?</p>



<p>[00:18:57] Andrew Palmer: Yeah. I mean you&#8217;re gonna save between 80 and 90% of your time that you would normally write a thousand word blog post.</p>



<p>[00:19:03] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah I guess one of the concerns from people who maybe want to rail against this a little bit would be that that kind of control, that self control to go and read it, may not be forthcoming. In other words, we may have an internet where there&#8217;s tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, possibly of blogs out there that are just pumping out content, click the button, publish.</p>



<p>[00:19:27] Andrew Palmer: Yeah but we&#8217;ve, let&#8217;s not be naive about this. We&#8217;ve always had that. There&#8217;s always been spinners of text and you know, the affiliate marketing world and the health and fitness world for years, you know, even before WordPress dare I say, you know, there was always people spinning content.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why things like Copyscape exist. Try and make sure that nobody&#8217;s using your content. But Bertha&#8217;s not just for blog post writing. Bertha actually helps you with every single aspect of your website. And the whole reason that we&#8217;ve got it in WordPress is because you can go through each model or each template. And you can write your homepage. You can write your services page, you can write your about us page. You can enhance your product descriptions.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s so many models now in templates in there now, and next week we&#8217;ll be launching social media templates as well. So you can write a Facebook ad or Twitter post or whatever, within Bertha. So, you know, there&#8217;s plenty to look at, and the fact it&#8217;s free is where I&#8217;m at. I think we&#8217;re helping the community get a grip with free AI. You get a thousand words a month for free.</p>



<p>[00:20:35] Nathan Wrigley: How does the UI actually work? So presumably we&#8217;re in Gutenberg or the old classic editor. How do we interact with it? So we click into the title, take us from there. Is it like Grammarly? Does something sort of hover over us, which says engage Bertha?</p>



<p>[00:20:48] Andrew Palmer: Pretty much. And it&#8217;s any page builder. It doesn&#8217;t need to be just classic editor or, it is literally any page builder. And the guys at visual builder, or Visual Composer rather. They helped us immensely with Visual Composer because they&#8217;ve rebuilt that from the ground up and helped us code Bertha so that she works perfectly with Visual Composer.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a Divi guy. I needed it to work within Divi. That was quite challenging. We&#8217;ve managed to do that. And Elementor as well. So whatever you are in, whether you are in a text field in Gutenberg or a text field within any page builder that you choose to use, Bertha&#8217;s little icon is there, just winking at you saying, I&#8217;m here to help. You click on that and then a sidebar comes out and then you&#8217;ve got all the models and you&#8217;ve got the web or the blog, website, content, blog, AIDA, PAS, P A S.</p>



<p>Uh, we&#8217;ve even got evil Bertha, she&#8217;s quite fun. Bit of a sarcastic bot there. That was one of my favorites that we put in there. Uh, and then you have, on a separate dashboard, you have long form as well. So that&#8217;s a separate thing where you can just write long form content. Format it for your blog, and that will save, save it within your own database. And the benefit of Bertha is one, it&#8217;s unlimited users, because anybody that can sign into your website can use Bertha. Two it&#8217;s really accessible for WordPress users. If you&#8217;re used to WordPress, you can use Bertha and you can start using Bertha effectively within 10 minutes.</p>



<p>The nice thing is, is that every single template has either a 30 second or one minute instructional video embedded in the sidebar. So you just play the video. You go, okay, that&#8217;s how I do that. The long form one, because it&#8217;s long form and it&#8217;s slightly more complex, you need to use a bit more logic with it, the instructional video is 10 minutes.</p>



<p>[00:22:30] Nathan Wrigley: The different language models that you&#8217;ve got, you mentioned the evil one and, you know, we could have the pirate one for example.</p>



<p>[00:22:36] Andrew Palmer: There is, we can do that tomorrow.</p>



<p>[00:22:37] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. But there could be the sales for example, or I don&#8217;t know, whatever it may be. They genuinely spit out different content? And is that composed with a different choice of verbs or a different choice of vocabulary. And if you go for the humorous one it&#8217;s gonna throw out some curve balls and some interesting fruity language?</p>



<p>[00:22:54] Andrew Palmer: Frank Sinatra.</p>



<p>[00:22:55] Nathan Wrigley: Okay.</p>



<p>[00:22:55] Andrew Palmer: Hey blue eyes, how you doing? We wanted it to be fun, right? So you&#8217;ve got the tone of voice. So you have your title. Who&#8217;s it aimed at? Is it business users, people that buy flowers, people that buy motorbikes, people that love WP Tavern? What&#8217;s the tone? Is it fun? Is it innovative? Is it classy? Is it hilarious? Is it Frank Sinatra? You know, you can put in those. Is it Rocky Balboa? You know, whatever you wanna put in there as the tone of voice. And, uh, Bertha will speak in that tone.</p>



<p>[00:23:25] Nathan Wrigley: Presumably GPT-3 means that there was a two and there will be a 4. Do you have any insight into that? Is that the kind of thing which rolls out on an annual basis?</p>



<p>[00:23:34] Andrew Palmer: GPT-3 has actually been improved. You&#8217;re on now DaVinci two. We use the highest engine, which is DaVinci ,and we use DaVinci two and there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s another thing called babble and other things within it. You can kind of downgrade it. So for evil Bertha we use, um, I think it&#8217;s babble because it kind of just, it&#8217;s more sarcastic. It kind of gives better results. So we test all the models within the playground of Open AI and then we go, okay, well that&#8217;s how we can write that.</p>



<p>Because we write the, we write the prompts and that&#8217;s the benefit of us being web developers. You know, Vito&#8217;s done thousand websites, I&#8217;ve done hundreds and maybe a couple of thousand three, three or 4,000 actually, if I look back on it, cuz I&#8217;m old these days and I&#8217;ve been building websites pre WebPress, right. Macromedia jobs and, even Front Page, but there you go.</p>



<p>We know what people want in a website. The content, the kind of flow, the blurbs, even the content. We&#8217;ve actually got a model for the contact form blurb. How to ask people to contact you. Because we know websites. We&#8217;ve built it specifically for website owners and website developers and producers, because getting content out of a client, that&#8217;s why Atarim exists. Getting content out of a client is like getting blood out of a stone. if you give them a method to do it or a way to do it, you&#8217;ll get it much quicker. You&#8217;ll complete your projects quicker. You will then be able to take on more projects.</p>



<p>[00:24:59] Nathan Wrigley: So that&#8217;s an interesting piece, isn&#8217;t it? The idea that you can, well previously you&#8217;d fill it up with lorem. If the client didn&#8217;t deliver the text, in goes lorem just to fill the space. To give it some indication of how it might look.</p>



<p>[00:25:10] Andrew Palmer: That&#8217;s why Bertha is called the Lorem Ipsum killer.</p>



<p>[00:25:13] Nathan Wrigley: There you go, so that&#8217;s a really bonafide use of it, isn&#8217;t You basically push the button, fill it up with actual content. And even if the client doesn&#8217;t want to use it, then of course, I guess they could go in and edit it, or just start again.</p>



<p>[00:25:25] Andrew Palmer: Exactly. Yeah. You can actually deliver a completed website to a client with text. In the right format, in the right places, everything. And it won&#8217;t add a great deal of time to your development process. It will save a massive amount of time on deliverables. The client will see it. They&#8217;ll get it. And they&#8217;ll go, well, actually, I don&#8217;t wanna use that word or I don&#8217;t, I think that&#8217;s outta context, let&#8217;s rewrite it to that, and you can even use Bertha to do that.</p>



<p>[00:25:50] Nathan Wrigley: So can you, as a website builder who maybe only wants certain permissions to go out to your clients, you can enable them to use Bertha or not use Bertha? There&#8217;s different permissions?</p>



<p>[00:26:00] Andrew Palmer: Yeah there is within the settings page. We&#8217;ve done a, a nice little dashboard, nice little onboarding as well, you know, makes it easier for people to understand what it is. And there&#8217;s an intro video on the onboarding as well, which will probably update because couple of things have slightly changed, but because we&#8217;ve embedded the instruction videos within Bertha, it makes it much easier.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re launching a deep dive academy in a few weeks time, and it is a few weeks time, because we&#8217;re just building out the long form videos. So educational videos of how to write a blog post, how to build a website from scratch using Bertha. How to use particular page builders and stuff. And that&#8217;s being done by Imran Sadiq who has been a godsend on the training. I mean he produced 54 training videos in just under 21 days. So he was a find, I&#8217;ve gotta tell you. He&#8217;s my, he&#8217;s my favorite person currently.</p>



<p>[00:26:50] Nathan Wrigley: When you push the button, and it spits out content. Presumably there&#8217;s a cost to that. In other words, it goes to a computer somewhere else. Maybe that&#8217;s your computer. Maybe it&#8217;s somebody else&#8217;s infrastructure. I don&#8217;t know, but there&#8217;s a cost for that transaction.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;m guessing that there&#8217;s gonna be constraints on the free version. Maybe that&#8217;s the number of times you can click the button, the amount of text you can produce, because I know that there&#8217;s a premium version as well. Just talk us around the pricing and the constraints that you&#8217;ve got.</p>



<p>[00:27:15] Andrew Palmer: Well, I made a decision because I, you know, I&#8217;ve invested in Bertha both time and money. I want people to use her. So a thousand words a month will cost me money, but that&#8217;s part of the investment, right? So currently, and I have no real reason to change this, everybody can use Bertha for free with every single model in it, except the new ones that I&#8217;ve said, because they are expensive to us.</p>



<p>So somebody&#8217;s gonna have to pay for those, and also pro users only get to use the academy as well. It&#8217;s free to pro users. So there are some constraints on the free use. But I, I love the fact that people are signing up. We&#8217;re getting probably 15 to 20 users signing up free per day, and they&#8217;re using it. Because we have a monitor. We, we don&#8217;t monitor what they use. We keep a record of what&#8217;s generated, but not by whom. You know, we don&#8217;t know which websites have generated, but that also helps us improve the model as well.</p>



<p>Also if it gives empty responses, which sometimes it does. But we can see we&#8217;ve got a little, when a new user starts, we can see that there&#8217;s zero. And then within 10 minutes of them starting, they&#8217;ve used 250 words. We&#8217;re thinking, yay. You know, they&#8217;re getting it. They&#8217;re really looking at it. And then they go to 1,012 words because we&#8217;ve done it just over the thousand, because there&#8217;s nothing more frustrating when you click that button, you run out of words.</p>



<p>So, you know, we let them, if it&#8217;s got to 998 and then they want to generate more, we let them generate the next sentence and they go, sorry, you gotta wait another month or upgrade. You know, of course I&#8217;m a very commercial person and people who know me know that I&#8217;m commercial, but you know, wait another month. But with a thousand words, you could write a homepage. You could write good about us page, whatever.</p>



<p>[00:28:57] Nathan Wrigley: The thought occurs to me that AI is getting its claw into almost everything. You&#8217;ve got Alexa in the living room and you&#8217;ve got the possibility to create pieces of artwork with all sorts of AI content. And I&#8217;m just wondering given your position, you&#8217;re obviously thinking a lot about AI. What do you make of the future of website building? So not the, not the content. Not that piece. The bit about the layout, the feel, the color palette, use of fonts.</p>



<p>Because I just find it almost inevitable that at some point we&#8217;re gonna be talking to the website building process, and we&#8217;re gonna be saying, I want a homepage with a picture of a stadium in the background with these words, and then you&#8217;ll see what it puts out and actually no change the font. Make it H2 instead of an H1 and so on. Do you think that&#8217;s closer than I&#8217;m imagining? Cause I&#8217;m still thinking that&#8217;s decades off.</p>



<p>[00:29:49] Andrew Palmer: Oh, it&#8217;s definitely not decades off. It&#8217;s 24 months off. You know, if you really, really get into it because, um, Google are working on image generation. But let&#8217;s also not forget that AI can examine an image and see what&#8217;s in it. So, the stock Adobes, the Shutterstocks of this world will think, well, hang on a second, we can tie up with an AI and ask it to recognize this gray head fella in a rowing boat, doing some fishing, whatever, no offense Nathan, and then produce that image.</p>



<p>And it would be, it wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have to be an AI generated image because there are millions of, of images out there. And imagine if you&#8217;ve got the WordPress repository with that&#8217;s now, and I&#8217;ve forgotten the name of where the images are on WordPress, but‚Ä¶</p>



<p>[00:30:34] Nathan Wrigley: Openverse.</p>



<p>[00:30:36] Andrew Palmer: So Openverse is an AI feeder of images. You know, I want a nice lakeside image with no people in it, because that&#8217;s part of the Openverse terms and conditions. There&#8217;s no people in it, but I want a nice lakeside view, in landscape and I want the sun to be shining. And the AI will go out and search that, find that, and place it within your Gutenberg block.</p>



<p>[00:30:55] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s interesting because I wonder, I wonder if people, so the particular next thing I&#8217;m gonna say relates to Bertha.ai. So I wonder if it&#8217;s got content creators, people whose job is to create copy. She&#8217;s got them shaking in their boots.</p>



<p>And also, I wonder if this event that we&#8217;re at WordCamp Europe, 2022. I wonder if in two or three years time given everything that you&#8217;ve just said, maybe coming down the pipe, if it will be a totally different experience. The whole build process will be different and we&#8217;ll be concerning ourselves with all sorts of other things.</p>



<p>And the block editor might be a very, very different thing. And page builders look different. With the rate of change, and the fact that AI can sort of seed itself and make itself cleverer, much, much more quickly than we can, I do wonder what it&#8217;s gonna be like in a few years.</p>



<p>[00:31:40] Andrew Palmer: There are some very clever people out there as well. You know, let&#8217;s not name drop too many people. Elementor for instance, who&#8217;ve got their cloud version now. In there, there&#8217;s a, a workflow and say, what type of websites you want? What do you want it to look like? What&#8217;s the colorways and boom, there it is. Extendify doing the same. You&#8217;ve got all the content blocks. What do you want in there? And you take you through a workflow.</p>



<p>WordPress will do that with their new $5 a month package, you know, and hosting and they&#8217;ll, they will build your website on the fly and, and, BoldGrid, I think it&#8217;s BoldGrid by, InMotion. It&#8217;s like a page builder that people don&#8217;t actually know about, but when I got into conversations with InMotion about them buying Elegant Marketplace, and I was basically a Divi marketplace, I&#8217;m saying, why don&#8217;t we make stuff BoldGrid, because you can go in there and say, I want a florist website.</p>



<p>Press a button, you&#8217;ve got 10 pages of flourish websites with all the images and the text. All you do is go in and edit the text. So that&#8217;s not AI, that&#8217;s just intelligent people saying, this is how we want people to build websites. So, with the advantages of AI and people like Matthew Renze, who I met in Las Vegas a few weeks ago. He&#8217;s at the top level of AI, and some conversations that I have with him, what&#8217;s coming, man is gonna blow your head off. It&#8217;s crazy what&#8217;s coming.</p>



<p>[00:32:57] Nathan Wrigley: On that bombshell. Andrew Palmer. Thanks for joining us.</p>



<p>[00:33:00] Andrew Palmer: You&#8217;re more than welcome Nathan. Thanks for letting me rabbit it on.</p>

Theme authors have frequently <a href="https://wptavern.com/ask-the-bartender-is-there-a-starter-for-building-block-themes">asked if there is a good starter theme for building block themes</a>, but at the moment there are really only a handful, as the block themes era is just dawning. </p>



<p>WebREDONE, a Serbia-based web agency, has open sourced its new starter theme, <a href="https://webredone.com/blog/wordpress-theme-starter-theme-redone/">Theme Redone</a>, that offers a foundation for building websites and Gutenberg blocks with an MVC framework:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We‚Äôve taken the inspiration from Laravel and other similar projects that really approached this aspect of coding cleverly and made it a breeze to organize and reason about the code.</p>



<p>In Laravel, we would write plain old PHP for the logic, and then we would use Blade templates for the View layer, we also have model, view, and controller files to separate the concerns and organize code logically and efficiently. We have adopted that same approach but in the context of the WordPress environment. Conceptually, the way we organize code is similar to Laravel, but with a few differences.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Theme Redone brings this approach to Gutenberg block files, identifying a &nbsp;<a href="https://webredone.com/theme-redone/gutenberg-blocks-framework/block-structure/model-json/">model.json</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://webredone.com/theme-redone/gutenberg-blocks-framework/block-structure/controller-php/">controller.php</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://webredone.com/theme-redone/gutenberg-blocks-framework/block-structure/view-latte/">view.latte</a> file. It uses the Latte templating engine. The JSON file contains the fields schemas with the data passed through to controller.php where it can be filtered or modified before getting passed to view.latte to be rendered on the front end. </p>



<img />Theme Redone Latte template files example



<p>The starter theme uses Gulp 4 and ESBuild for compilation and watching tasks, configured to support React, Svelte, Vue, and Petite Vue out of the box. Its <a href="https://github.com/webredone/theme-redone">GitHub page</a> summarizes everything included in the framework:</p>



<ul><li>&nbsp;<a href="https://webredone.com/theme-redone/why-latte-as-a-templating-engine/">Latte templating engine</a>&nbsp;for its beautiful syntax and a more streamlined and manageable workflow</li><li>&nbsp;EsBuild/Webpack + Gulp task tasks for&nbsp;<a href="https://webredone.com/theme-redone/scss-and-js-compilation-bundling/">compiling SCSS and JS</a></li><li>&nbsp;SCSS (SMACSS folder/files structure)</li><li>&nbsp;Javascript (ES8 and React/Svelte/Vue support, thanks to EsBuild and Babel)</li><li>&nbsp;In-theme&nbsp;<a href="https://webredone.com/theme-redone/gutenberg-blocks-framework/">framework for building Gutenberg blocks</a>&nbsp;in a streamlined and standardized way</li><li>&nbsp;<a href="https://webredone.com/theme-redone/gutenberg-blocks-framework/trb-cli/">TRB CLI</a>&nbsp;helper for scaffolding new Gutenberg blocks</li><li>&nbsp;<a href="https://webredone.com/theme-redone/simple-grid-system/">Bare-bones grid system</a>&nbsp;coded with Flex and CSS variables (about 15 lines of code)</li><li>&nbsp;<a href="https://webredone.com/theme-redone/theme-functions/">Helper functions</a>&nbsp;for repetitive tasks such as rendering images, links, SVG code, and more</li><li>&nbsp;Just a few&nbsp;<a href="https://webredone.com/theme-redone/javascript-ui-elements-classes/">well-written UI components</a>&nbsp;to get you started (we don‚Äôt like bloat in our code): Modal, Accordion, Tabs, Menu, Dropdowns, Sliders, and simple ‚Äúin view fade-in transitions‚Äù</li><li>&nbsp;<a href="https://webredone.com/theme-redone/svg-handling/">SVG support</a></li><li>&nbsp;<a href="https://webredone.com/theme-redone/debugging-tracy/">Tracy Debugger</a>&nbsp;to help us make sure we write stable and error-free code</li></ul>



<p>WebREDONE has developed a fast way to create new blocks through its <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webredone/trb-cli" target="_blank">TRB CLI (Theme Redone Blocks)</a>¬†NPM package, which will instantly create a new block with a single terminal command. It includes a custom UI along with the block preview image. The UI looks out of place inside block editor and somewhat more restricted in terms of controls available to users. This may not matter if the agency is creating sites that are not edited by users, but it seems confusing. </p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>The theme&#8217;s creators have also written <a href="https://webredone.com/theme-redone/">50 pages of documentation</a> over the course of two months, including how to get started, working with the template files, the theme&#8217;s helper functions, block structure within the framework, and more. </p>

Select extensions can be loaded up on a private test site for 30 days before the site self-destructs.</p>



<p>Although WooCommerce.com already offers a 30 day money back guarantee if users are unhappy with a purchase, the sandbox testing offers a frontline prevention for customers having to invoke the money back guarantee. It saves both parties time and resources by allowing customers to test extensions against their unique inventory of needs without committing to buy.</p>



<p>The flow for this feature is strategic in that it requires prospective customers to log in or create an account in order to test an extension. This enables users to come back and revisit their test sites later during the decision-making process. WooCommerce.com can also collect data on how many sandboxes are started for each of its extensions and determine which ones are struggling to convert. I would not be surprised if WooCommerce ends up streamlining these sandboxes for better conversions.</p>



<img />



<p>In my test of this feature I chose the WooCommerce Pre-Orders extension. Once logged in, the site loaded up in seconds with the extension already activated on an empty store. I was successfully able to create a product as being available for pre-order.</p>



<img />



<p>The live testing feature is not yet available for all extensions. WooCommerce engineer R√©mi Corson reports that it&#8217;s currently active on the following products (with more on come in the future): follow-up emails, product add-ons, product CSV import suite, product vendors, table rate shipping, bookings, checkout field editor, points and rewards, and  pre-orders. Any of the available extensions can be simultaneously activated on an existing test site.</p>



<p>WooCommerce.com&#8217;s sandbox sites are set up strictly for testing extensions in a simple way. This may not be the best if you need to rule out conflicts with other extensions during your tests. The test sites do not allow you to install a different theme or add any other plugins.</p>



<p>In most cases, the live testing feature should be adequate to answer most questions users have prior to purchasing an extension. It&#8217;s also great for demonstrating to a client in case of the necessity to justify the expense. Some of these extensions are in the range of $100-$249/year billed annually, which is not a trivial expense for people who are just getting started with a store and wondering if the extension will suit their needs.</p>



<p>WooCommerce.com is one of many digital product creators in the WordPress space that already employs this type of testing, though the life of the sandbox varies from an hour to several weeks. Offering instant live testing is definitely the way to go if you don&#8217;t want to offer a free version of your extension where users would pay to upgrade. It saves users the hassle of having to set up their own test sites and get a refund, but also allows them to truly browse a host of commercial add-ons that they may not have otherwise thought to explore.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 01:37:56 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Not all users hunt for their next theme directly on WordPress.org.

<p>This is an interative process, and more pages on .org are in the works. The next step is to get the Navigation right, as with 12 top-level menu items it&#8217;s confusion and can send people into decision paralysis as to where they might find the relevant information. The discussion was kicked-off by <strong>Matt Mullenweg</strong>, co-founder of WordPress in his latest post: <strong>Navigation</strong>. With so many different target audiences, content creators, plugin and themes developers, contributors, free-lance and agency developers, developers at companies, #nocoe site builders, there is probably not one pathway into the information about wordPress.

<p><strong>Andrew Ozz</strong>, Core Committer, explained in his latest post the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/18/wordpress-development-setup/"><strong>WordPress Development Setup</strong></a> and answered questions, like: &#8220;Why is Gutenberg being developed on GitHub or why is Core not being developed there?&#8221; and &#8220;Is Gutenberg a WordPress&nbsp;feature plugin?&#8221; He started out stating: <em>Core is Gutenberg and Gutenberg is Core. </em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" />



<p>After discussion over several months, <strong>Adam Zielinski </strong>published a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/10/proposal-stop-merging-experimental-apis-from-gutenberg-to-wordpress-core/"><strong>Proposal to stop merging experimental APIs from Gutenberg to WordPress Core</strong></a>. The Gutenberg plugin is in active development and new features are created all the time. These new features come also with new APIs that are declared &#8216;experimental&#8217; until the team is sure that it&#8217;s a prudent implementation for this part of block editor. </p>



<p>When a major WordPress release is worked on, Gutenberg plugin code is merged with WordPress Core, and when these experimental APIs make it into the stable version of WordPress, they also earn consideration for backwards compatibility and de-facto code that needs to be maintained for a  few versions before they can be deprecated again.  </p>



<p>Adam Zielinski suggests that before a feature makes it into Core that experiemental APis are audited and either are not merged into WordPress or worked on to migrate them as stable APIs. If a feature depending on  an experiemental API is not yet stable enough, and other features also depend on the API, both should not be deemed mergable to the next major WordPress version. </p>



<p>Other developers caution, that it might slow down the pace when new block editor features come to WordPress. For the impatient that might be of concern, I also have the feeling that it&#8217;s not a bad thing, when Gutenberg latests features stay in the oven to bake a little longer before they are merged and used by millions of people. </p>

It&#8217;s an interesting perspective on a discussion on how plugin follow along core development or isolate their features from future core development and by that lock any plugin use in their specific functionality and architecture. </p>

<p>The workshop: <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2022/08/10/using-the-create-block-tool/"><strong>Using the create-block Tool</strong></a>, with <strong>Jonathan Bossenger</strong> is not available on WordPressYC. &#8220;The WordPress create-block tool allows you to quickly scaffold a new block plugin. You will learn what you need to get started with create-block, how to use it, and review the code it generates.</p>

<p><strong>Adam Zielinski</strong> posted a tutorial on how to <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/data-basics/"><strong>create your First App with Gutenberg Data</strong></a> in the block editor handbook.  This tutorial aims to get you comfortable with the Gutenberg data layer. It guides you through building a simple React application that enables the user to manage their WordPress pages. It had five chapters. You&#8217;ll learn the environment setup, build a basic set of pages, create an edit form, create a page form and how to add a delete button.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap" id="block-8a500c95-b0bb-4e84-9b38-6d634a0946b2">I've appreciated much of the criticism that's been offered to the Five for the Future program in the last few weeks. It represents an investment in time, thought, and care of a lot of people who all have positive intentions, however harsh many of the more candid takes have been. </p>



<p id="block-8a500c95-b0bb-4e84-9b38-6d634a0946b2">And it has been a real heap of opinion that's not easy to sort. Still, it's been an occasion to learn and think more deeply about the culture and history of WordPress, how things work or don't work. WordPress needs that.</p>



<blockquote><p>It's not a bad thing if pushback on some concepts like &#8220;tragedy of the commons&#8221; and &#8220;free riders&#8221; drives us to find better ones.</p></blockquote>



<p id="block-e9c2d9c0-bab0-4396-8095-5420f2f96305">It's not a bad thing if pushback on some concepts like &#8220;tragedy of the commons&#8221; and &#8220;free riders&#8221; drives us to find better ones. Clarifying language and coming to some consensus about the terms and definitions that help people understand the project is really important.</p>



<p id="block-718bb272-a14c-4904-ab72-ded6fd3e100e">However, a lot of valid points about those terms and the details of the 5ftF program got deep into the weeds or focused on things that simply are what they are and aren't going to change.</p>



<p>(That's the stuff that gets labelled &#8220;drama&#8221; and falls on deaf ears or gets batted around unhelpfully by people who should have better things to do.  Everyone has heard it a million times. Don't worry, I'm not going to touch any of it.)</p>



<h2 id="block-5c310172-f0f5-4a15-89fb-9d9383586416">We can only move forward, but are we living in the past?</h2>



<p id="block-6c135ce9-57d9-48af-8a0d-e0bd756ba174">As an open source project, the only question that really matters is, &#8220;What will drive WordPress forward?&#8221; Not in an ideal or theoretical world but with the army we have.</p>



<p id="block-563ef72a-ad24-4271-bdaa-2d540b279c33">Or, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/project/2022/08/01/open-source-and-the-free-rider-problem/">as Josepha Haden-Chomphosy put it</a>: &#8220;How can we rebalance the tenacious need for contribution with the immense benefit WordPress brings to everyone&#8221; in the WordPress ecosystem?</p>



<p id="block-cb7c0968-427e-4652-8704-a63477ffcd44">That question got lost in the reactions, but it's the one that matters most.</p>



<blockquote><p>Notice how these words are delicately balanced and easily tipped over. You can read &#8220;tenacious need for contribution&#8221; as a threatening demand ‚Äî a clawback on a &#8220;benefit&#8221; you might not consider &#8220;immense&#8221; or as immense as someone else's.</p></blockquote>



<p id="block-907aaa2f-8d3f-45af-9c7a-9bfe571224f6">Notice how these words are delicately balanced and easily tipped over. You can read that &#8220;tenacious need for contribution&#8221; as a threatening demand ‚Äî a clawback on a &#8220;benefit&#8221; you might not consider &#8220;immense&#8221; or as immense as someone else's. You can read it as a description of scarcity all on one side and abundance all on the other. You could tear it up and set it on fire. </p>



<p>And some people do do that. </p>



<h2>The world as it is</h2>



<p id="block-42326f40-b8b4-4d74-af21-e69be310347a">Especially in the world of WordPress extenders, builders, and generally small business operators doing well enough to start a podcast or opinion blog, this seems to be where we get stuck. (That's the big, long tail of the open source communities I've been in for two decades.) I've watched this all happen before around an open source CMS that once dominated the market. Imbalances, inequities, and unfairness got emphasized, and the community didn't get past its deadlock of grievances.</p>



<p id="block-42326f40-b8b4-4d74-af21-e69be310347a">I'm not going to say there aren't imbalances and all the playing fields are perfectly level because that's not true. (It never is, anywhere.) But I will say it doesn't do any good to keep saying this. Repetition of failed patterns is not just a definition of derangement, it is a failure to grow into mature thinking. To really face the world as it is requires a capacity for living with apparently unsolvable contradictions. It is less about &#8220;being smart&#8221; and more about a tolerance for the mental stress and pain of not having control or all the answers. It's fucking hard, but not being able to do it does harm to individuals and the groups they're in. </p>



<blockquote><p>We can cope better with hard problems and survive to solve them another day if we first get ourselves united around common interests, motivations, and values. And that is the task our oldest, most adapatable, legacy systems ‚Äî human languages ‚Äî were invented to do as we muddle along together on this planet.</p></blockquote>



<p id="block-505bdd5e-f2fe-4c3c-9673-566df571dcf1">I'm also not going to say we can make deep problems disappear by not talking about them or by using evasive language. I do think we can cope better with hard problems and survive to solve them another day if we first get ourselves united around common interests, motivations, and values. And that is the task that human languages were invented for.</p>



<p id="block-24ad1539-b961-418f-b0f9-9d1098a1392a">There's nothing like an external threat to unite people, usually. Lately there's been a lot of concern about the end to growth and possible losses in WordPress' market share. I'd worry more about losing relevance with younger generations of people with different outlooks, interests, and needs. That's people doing stuff. It's real. Market share will always be a statistic that dimly reflects what people are doing long after they started doing it. Today's failure to connect and communicate won't register on <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/cms">the BuiltWith pie chart</a> for years when it's too late to get in front of.</p>



<h2>Creators in community</h2>



<p id="block-7dad336b-aaf2-4a48-a2c5-be3f8cb710ce">So let's talk about the &#8220;Creator Economy.&#8221; It's not a trend but a pretty established thing now. Creators with a course, service, or product to sell generally don't want to focus too much on tools and even less on code ‚Äî unless code is their service or product.</p>



<blockquote><p>That's where WordPress should be, and in a sense it is, but it uses the language of a 20 year-old open source project that is illegible to people in their 20s today.</p></blockquote>



<p id="block-7d4fd33c-af8a-440d-807f-2e3f36ae4772">WordPress and ever-increasing, low-cost, easy-to-use SaaS platforms have enabled Creators to focus on their business. Unlike those of us who were doing this back in the Stone Age, Creators don't have to install WordPress, try to bolt on installs of phpBB, GNU Mailman, and learn PHP4 to cope with a once-popular horror like osCommerce. Creators are in, or adjacent to the WordPress community, but they're unlikely to participate in it and contribute in the old, traditional ways that start with bugs and hacking. Software that's free as in beer and speech isn't attractive or even meaningful unless it's presented as a useful platform for their particular niche. </p>



<p id="block-7d4fd33c-af8a-440d-807f-2e3f36ae4772">This is painful to hear, especially if this is how you entered the open source and WordPress community. Many of us became developers, designers, freelancers, communication and marketing consultants, and even product or agency founders this way. That was a different time in a different country ‚Äî once the main doorway into WordPress, it's now a small, creaky backdoor.</p>



<p id="block-f154735a-096a-4c53-a676-455606234ca8">If you think this means Creators are narcissists and mercenaries who don't participate in communities or care about their tools, you are wrong. Helping them organize into communities that give them value is a smart move. WordPress products, especially ecosystem plugins, virtually grow their own communities. With a now-private Facebook page that's grown to over 133,000 members, <a href="https://elementor.com/">Elementor is the biggest example of this</a>, and they are pivoting to redefine themselves accordingly. Their identity doesn't emphasize a WordPress plugin but a platform (and community) for Creators. </p>



<p id="block-f02749a6-c26d-4c1c-a349-444397d597d0">That's where WordPress should be, and in a sense it is, but it uses the language of a 20 year-old open source project that is illegible to most people in their teens and twenties today. And if they look a little way into the very limited &#8220;WordPress news&#8221; space, Creators aren't going to see Creators there. Certainly not a wide range of artists and makers. They may see &#8220;drama&#8221; and arguments, or &#8220;inside-baseball&#8221; like this post.</p>



<h2 id="block-b4807b88-ab9a-4ce7-9086-3d43929ede71">Craft + Commerce and WordCamp US</h2>



<p id="block-60bdea77-3b00-4542-8adb-25b820780a7d">I found Joe Casabona's &#8220;<a href="https://wpreview.io/a-tale-of-two-keynotes/">Tale of Two Keynotes</a>&#8221; really helpful for understanding some key threats and opportunities WordPress needs to face in the context of today's Creator Economy. Joe's main point is that Creators focus on earning and growth in their businesses in a context where this message is encouraged and prioritized ‚Äî and WordPress needs more of that. I'm not opposed to that view, but it's not the main thing I got out of Joe's post and want to elaborate here.</p>



<p id="block-3af73ea5-8fda-4846-8a60-557c2b9dc5ee">Joe looks at the language ConvertKit founder Nathan Barry used to invite community participation in his last keynote for Craft + Commerce, a major conference aimed at Creators in his hometown of Boise, Idaho. Then he looks at the language of participation in Matt Mullenweg's speech in <a href="https://poststatus.com/post-status-comments-no-4-state-of-the-word-2021-analysis/">the last State of the Word</a>. </p>



<p id="block-fff2770d-4439-4673-9878-843a5481044a">Barry emphasized goals that could be summed up as, &#8220;You can and should make a good living doing what you love in the creator economy!&#8221;</p>



<blockquote><p>Here are the <a href="https://poststatus.com/post-status-team-responses-to-the-state-of-the-word-2021/">Post Status team responses to SotW 2021</a>. Rereading my own remarks, I'm reminded of how optimistic that moment was ‚Äî about all the same themes I'm touching here.</p></blockquote>



<p id="block-98dc48a3-e947-4e5f-8260-33984b488b5d">Matt emphasized learning through contribution and the danger of more being taken out than given back. What stands out most in my memory is his &#8220;Give a penny, take a penny&#8221; analogy for open source.</p>



<p id="block-18f2b1bb-119f-47db-b4cf-0ec4cb188eec">(That's not a knock on Matt, pennies, his analogy, or least of all the idea that you learn by doing ‚Äî with others who know more. Post Status is all about that. We repeat &#8220;learn by helping&#8221; all the time. An example of this actually went out in our latest newsletter. But I do think &#8220;learn how to earn together&#8221; is a unique emphasis of the Post Status community within WordPress, and it is closer to Barry's language than anything as close to the project as Post Status is.)</p>



<p id="block-2c2832da-0b83-467c-80a9-e5a11f17d025">As he seemed to intend, Matt's keynote reminded me of the values of small towns at their best, where I've lived about half my life. That part of me sees Barry as a bit of a huckster ‚Äî sure, everyone's winner! What exactly is he giving you? Lifetime free access to ConvertKit? Or just high fives?</p>



<p id="block-a1fad17e-5613-49e7-85d8-4783932d616c">I don't see the two keynotes reflecting scarcity versus abundance thinking or even two very different attitudes, but if you wanted to polarize people over them you could. Pick on the vulnerabilities of one, and amplify the strengths of the other. </p>



<p>There are strengths and limitations to both emphases ‚Äî Creating and Contributing.</p>



<p id="block-a1fad17e-5613-49e7-85d8-4783932d616c">What if we tried to combine the strengths of the language of contribution with new, complementary ideas and language from the Creator Economy?</p>



<h2 id="block-145fb39a-674f-43b8-8c1f-67c8f17881cb">&#8220;Creators&#8221; vs. &#8220;Contributors&#8221;</h2>



<p id="block-9a877702-0b72-40e0-a837-7a43f5155548">There are strengths and limitations attached to both of these words when they're used to define identity and participation in a creative community. <em>Creating</em> and <em>Contributing</em>. They don't seem very different until you take a close look.</p>



<blockquote><p>Creating manages to hold together both ideas of giving <em>and</em> gaining. Creativity is about making things you care about deeply and are inspired to work on. When you create something it's a gift to everyone, potentially, and to yourself.</p></blockquote>



<p id="block-254f7428-0dd8-4a8e-adfb-d7d3f458a8eb">Contributing has distinct emphasis on giving, not getting back. It is a zero-sum transaction between a contributor and recipient of contributions. To use the language of contribution effectively, you probably have to be seen as truly having a greater need than the people you are asking to contribute more. Better yet, they should see themselves as implicitly benefiting from their contributions. </p>



<p id="block-254f7428-0dd8-4a8e-adfb-d7d3f458a8eb">If they don't believe this is true, repeating the old magic words will not work unless you do it live on air, interrupting normal programming until enough contributions have come in. Until next time. (Kind of like Admin Notifications used for upselling premium plugins.) </p>



<p id="block-991b730c-d674-41c3-abf1-e7068185e881">Creating manages to hold together both ideas of giving <em>and</em> gaining. Creativity is about making things you care about deeply and are inspired to work on. When you create something it's a gift to everyone, potentially, and to yourself.</p>



<h2>So what should we do differently?</h2>



<p id="block-9231192c-53a9-490f-b067-64e4d295c356">Am I proposing a massive Search and Replace targeting all forms of the word &#8220;Contribute&#8221; in WordPress? Nope. I personally find calling people &#8220;Creators&#8221; more cringey than the older, grammatically tortured term, &#8220;Creatives.&#8221; But I recognize when I am out of date, and I am willing to adapt where I see value in doing so.</p>



<p id="block-9231192c-53a9-490f-b067-64e4d295c356">I'm not proposing anything but that we think more carefully about language, tone, and audience. What we emphasize with one word or story as opposed to another may close or open doors with different people. It's good to have a lot of options to engage a lot of people. It's good to be flexible and adaptable. It's good to know what connects and unites.</p>



<p id="block-e55a849a-8cf5-48f7-b311-570266746adf">Do we know?<br /><br />Can we create it?</p>



<p id="block-2d71356b-5b29-428e-a3e8-3618cb28851a">Can we teach it to each other?</p>

<p>In celebration of World Photography Day, WordPress&#8217; Photo Directory team has <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/photos/2022/08/18/wordpress-world-photography-day-challenge-2022/">issued a challenge</a> designed to get people contributing:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Submit a photo that captures something unique about your local area</strong>, in a way that helps represent the geographic diversity of the WordPress community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since its launch, the WordPress Photo Directory has grown to 3,633 free, CC0-licensed photos. The purpose of this challenge is to raise awareness of the directory project and encourage people to contribute photos to expand the collection.</p>



<p>Photo contributors are encouraged to submit an original image of something from their local area (neighborhood, town, city, or country), such as a landscape, street, local wildlife, nature, or a landmark. In addition to following the directory guidelines, participants should also add the following information to denote their work as part of this initiative: </p>



<ul><li>(1) The location or where the image was taken (e.g. the city and/or country)</li><li>(2) The word WorldPhotographyDay22</li></ul>



<p>Photo Directory team contributor Marco Almeida has an additional recommendation for well-known locations that have an English counterpart for the name in the original language:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Quick suggestion for submissions: if you‚Äôre uploading a photo that has regional interest and the name of the place is not the same in English and the local language, do repeat the photo description in both languages. For example: ‚Äú<em>Walking on Lisbon‚Äôs sidewalk &#8211; A andar na cal√ßada de Lisboa</em>‚Äù. This will ensure the photo is both searchable by ‚ÄúLisbon‚Äù and ‚ÄúLisboa‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Submitted photos that are approved may be featured across WordPress.org&#8217;s social media channels. Photo contributors will also get a contributor badge on their WordPress.org profiles, which I was surprised to find on mine after contributing <a href="https://wordpress.org/photos/photo/26962070d8/">a picture of my morning oatmeal</a> a few months ago. </p>



<img />



<p>Participants can submit up to five photos at a time but will have to wait until those pass through review before submitting more. If your photo is approved, the Photo Directory team requests you leave a comment on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/photos/2022/08/18/wordpress-world-photography-day-challenge-2022/">challenge post</a> with the link to the photo and the story behind it.</p>



<p>More specific instructions for submitting photos are available in the announcement. If you are a photography enthusiast, this challenge is a great opportunity to give back to the world of free WordPress resources. The challenge will conclude on August 28, 2022.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 01:24:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<img />



<p>YITH Wonder includes 24 different patterns &#8211; many of them aimed at shops. Since the company specializes in WooCommerce products, it&#8217;s no surprise that YITH Wonder offers corresponding styles for WooCommerce products, shop pages, cart, and checkout.</p>



<img />



<p>The theme also includes three full-page patterns for different homepage layouts and designs. These are very helpful for quickly putting together a page without having to hunt for and place each pattern in the right place. The full-page patterns can easily be previewed on the theme&#8217;s listing on WordPress.org: (<a href="https://wp-themes.com/yith-wonder/?page_id=2&pattern_name=yith-wonder/homepage-1">Homepage 1</a>, <a href="https://wp-themes.com/yith-wonder/?page_id=2&pattern_name=yith-wonder/homepage-2">Homepage 2</a>, and <a href="https://wp-themes.com/yith-wonder/?page_id=2&pattern_name=yith-wonder/homepage-3">Homepage 3)</a>.</p>



<p>YITH Wonder comes with six different style variations that make it easy to change the the accent color combinations and typography for the site.</p>



<img />



<p>Check out the <a href="https://wonder.yithemes.com/ecommerce/">live demo</a> on the theme&#8217;s website. One handy feature on the demo is that you can click &#8220;Launch Sandbox&#8221; to instantly spin up a test site with the theme and WooCommerce pre-loaded. The sandbox sites expire after one hour. This gives a user the opportunity to explore the full-site editing features and see if the theme will work for their particular use case. For example, users can see how the WooCommerce product catalog template will look with their own customizations applied. The theme packages two dozen different templates and template parts that can be customized inside the Site Editor.</p>



<img />



<p>YITH Wonder is listed as a multi-purpose WordPress theme in the directory but it really shines as one of the few free block-based themes built with WooCommerce in mind. Creating a new page and slapping one of the full-page patterns on it is a delightful experience that will save users time in getting started and also enable them to build targeted pages featuring different product categories or sale items.</p>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/yith-wonder/">YITH Wonder</a> is available to download on WordPress.org for free. I couldn&#8217;t find any documentation for the theme, but it may be available once the company formally announces the theme on the YITH website.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 21:29:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> [00:00:00] Hey NY, how are you doing today?</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Hey, Dan, I'm doing well. How are you?</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Good. Good. Pretty good for, uh, winding in towards the end of the week. I know. Um, let's see, your, your newsletter from master VP goes out Tuesday in our productions Friday. So maybe you can, it goes out Wednesday. Oh Wednesday now. Okay. Yeah.</p>



<p>Tuesday, Tuesdays. You're getting it already. Yeah. Okay. So you're kind of, is this the down slope for you? easier time,</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> eh, yeah, it is. It is. The beginning of the week is always like, alright, make sure everything's together. And then it's like, ah, you know, breathe and like can hop in and getting ready for next week.</p>



<p>So it definitely is. And it's almost Friday. Yeah. All good news.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah, for us it's like, yeah, it's the, the high, when you get it all done on, on Friday and then the weekend. So, um, you've been at it for about six months. I read your your six month. Article, uh, post [00:01:00] there and reflection on all the stuff you, you guys have done in that time.</p>



<p>Um, yeah. How are you, how are you feeling about, um, about not just doing master WP, but this is kind of a new thing for you jumping straight into the, um, the WordPress community as someone who's, um, you know, come, come in from, uh, not that, not that long ago for the first. .</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. So, um, I've had, I have a experience in WordPress, so I've been coding in WordPress for a couple years.</p>



<p>Um, I've been writing and editing for what 16 years. Um, and just, yeah, putting it all together to be like a part of the community to be a part of the writing, to be a part of, you know, everything that's going on. Um, it has been. Fun. I don't wanna say that first. It's been very fun. Um, it's also been very entertaining.</p>



<p>it's been [00:02:00] very interesting. Um, Hmm. It's been. Oh, oh, it's been just a journey. And, um, it's just been six months, but I've learned a lot. I've met a lot of really good people and I've got to do, I've gotten to do a lot of really cool things. Um, I'm really excited for the rest of this, the next six months. I'm just I'm ready for that year article, like to just talk about everything we did in a year, um, But, um, I think the most interesting thing about it is, um, just, just getting to know so many people in the community, not just in the community, because like I was, I've been in the community for years as a coder, but I haven't been like, you know, an active participant in like, as far as meeting people.</p>



<p>So meeting active people in the community has been really awesome.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, that's really different. Isn't it? I, I relate. It's a lot. I feel, um, I, I feel similarly because despite going back early long way with open source and, and WordPress [00:03:00] site, I probably got more involved long ago in other communities and I've stayed.</p>



<p>Stayed for a long time in a, you know, relatively quiet, neutral space relative to, to post status and, and, um, and just, um, my own work for a long time. But it's, yeah, it's relatively recently that my role has kind of expanded and changed and re not, I wouldn't say required, but made it natural to, um, and if not, Necessary to, uh, you know, be more engaged in social media and, um, and just, yeah, the kind of networking that, that comes around from that and the, the way that people, uh, connect with you more when you're, you're taking more of a public role.</p>



<p>Um, yeah. There's ups and downs, ups and downs to that. How, how do you, what, what do you see the pros and cons [00:04:00] or what have been the highs and lows for you?</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, the pros would be the people I've met, um, as a relative newcomer to the community and someone that's trying to get more people in, um, being, you know, editorial director of master WP has opened me to so many resources.</p>



<p>There are so many people that want to help in this community. And I feel like that does not, nobody really talks about that. That doesn't, uh, that never makes it out of the screams. Drama whatever's going on that week in WordPress, but there are so many people that want to help the community, especially newbies, but they don't know how, or they they're more.</p>



<p>So I will, I have resources for you to help, which is still helping. And I was able to connect with a lot of people. Um, I have been given a lot of resources for just starting my own word, press meetups in my city. I was just living in and the city I'm doing now. People just they've read and they've seen things I've [00:05:00] doing they're let me start over.</p>



<p>They've read things I've written and they've seen things I'm doing and that spurred them to help. So it's been mostly positive. Um, for me. Great. Um, some of the cons is, um, something I, I'm not new to leadership. I'm not new to taking ownership of things. I've had my own business before, things like that. Um, I guess the biggest thing for me is when master WP gets negative, press.</p>



<p>that's all people wanna talk about to me. Uh, if they talk about that, amongs the self that's, whatever that's it's okay. But when lots of really positive things happen, like I said, like me gaining these resources, us having, helping new people get into the community, people, uh, you know, changing their tune on things.</p>



<p>They just didn't have information about which we've, we've been told all of us that that's helped at least someone, no, it is nothing. Nobody really wants to talk about it. And it could be because negative stuff, you know, people aren't louder when they're negative. Versus they're a little bit more [00:06:00] quiet when they're positive, but that's something that it didn't bother me at first, but it was overwhelming after a little while.</p>



<p>Mm. Because. I'm a person, like if it's something's negative, that's going on, I would like to work with you on it. But I quickly discovered a lot of people don't want that. They just wanna be negative and, you know, yeah. So navigating that's been interesting. Um, and then we, we, we shifted a lot. Master WP is completely different than what it was under.</p>



<p>Um, the old ownership. And I think a lot of people had a problem with that as well. Um, especially when we talked about race and diversity and oh, my favorite giving people money. I understand that. Cuz I talk about that in regular life. I've been a community organizer for years. I do community service. Um, and I don't, I don't have to answer to an organization to do that.</p>



<p>I do stuff out of my own pocket. That's how I am. So this stuff is not new to me. Um, but it's, it's interesting to see people [00:07:00] take on those. You shouldn't be helping people or you shouldn't be doing. In a space where they constantly is, need a need for help. So I've, I've learned a lot. It's it's it helps me ponder and wonder.</p>



<p>And, um, I, I don't know. I'm just, I'm very interested to see what else I learned because six months, depending on who you talk to is not a long time. I don't feel like that was a long time, but I poof I've learned a lot. So this year should be pretty epic.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah. You really jump right in and yeah, when you do so.</p>



<p>Public like that. And you're, you're putting out the kind of material you do on, um, writing and, and podcasting mm-hmm um, yeah, you get, you get a lot, learn a lot from getting a lot of reactions fast and when you become the news it's, it's not, not awesome. I have a little experience with that. But yeah, no one can really control the message all the time.</p>



<p>And, [00:08:00] uh, being able to roll with that is, is good. But, um, yeah, I hope the, the positives outweigh the negatives. Where, where do you think the, um, some of the pushback or raised hackles? Come from, is it just, who are you to say, just where does this new, you know, just reaction of, of established or familiar, um, people who are familiar with the space and, and feel really, um, comfortable in it, the way it is.</p>



<p>And then I don't know who you are. You just come out of, you know, you're offering new perspectives and, you know, different, different takes on things or, um, is that. Is that just kind of the newcomer, um, challenge that I don't know, human social groups always seem to, to</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> have. Oh, I would be surprised if that wasn't playing a part into it.</p>



<p>I mean, because, um, some people I have talked [00:09:00] with interviewed, you know, written to they've written to me, you know, they've been in this community like. Years and years while I might have been still been in high school, things like that. So I definitely, I, I could see some of that. Definitely. Um, I guess the big thing is nobody really addresses a lot of negative issues with me, which, which I'm totally prepared for as editorial director.</p>



<p>I it's, it's always secondhand stuff. And it's like, how do you address that? I'm one of these people, like I said, I address things and that people take that in a negative way. I don't understand that. Like I. I have always been able to communicate with people. If there's a issue, I think we can solve it if we talk about it.</p>



<p>But I don't think a lot of people have that point of view. They don't want to talk, they don't wanna solve issues. They just want you to know they are not feeling it. And that's also fun. But, you know, as a person who's a doer, I can only accept so much of that, you know, send it to me, but what do you want me to do with it after a while it's gonna be my response.</p>



<p>Um, so it, [00:10:00] you know, there. I'm a newbie, you know, we're new, I guess we're as a whole newish people on the scene. Um, although Rob and Brian and a lot of our, uh, developers have been in WordPress years. Mm-hmm um, there's also I don't know what I I'll call it. I always try to make up my own names for things.</p>



<p>Um, it's getting into the group. I guess liking what everyone else likes and hating what everyone else hates, which we, we won't do. And master WP is right. Individual people. We, we also, that's a big issue too. We get, if Rob has an issue on something, that means we all think it, if Brian has an issue on something that makes we all think it, if I have an issue with something that means we all think it and, um, that's not true at all.</p>



<p>Yeah. We are very open and diverse about that, but that, that gets lost too. So I think it's. , you know, we're not as a whole waiting and liking the right things. I can tell you as a person, an individual that will never be me. I've never been able to do that. [00:11:00] Friends, family work. Yeah. I've never been able to do that.</p>



<p>So it won't be me, but, um, I think that plays a part into it too. And then I just think, you know, We're saying things that some people have told me privately, they wanna say, but they can't. So it's a number of things which I am so interested and totally down to explore in the next six months.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> That's good curiosity.</p>



<p>helps, especially with, with negatives. Um, yeah. Why in, instead of just hardening up or closing off or writing people off, um, there's always something to learn. You know, it occurred to me listening. what you're, um, saying there about a publication with a lot of voices. Mm-hmm um, it occurs to me that there isn't we, and we talk about this a lot, the WordPress news space or whatever you want to call it.</p>



<p>It's pretty small. Mm-hmm and um, most of the people in it are, you know, we're pretty [00:12:00] small team at post status, but, um, there's, there's multiple voices and we, we aspire to. To have that, um, kind of sense of dialogue, but a lot of people are just doing, you know, it's one, one person, one personality. And so you, you get kind of used to their perspective on things mm-hmm , mm-hmm and maybe there's not as much of a familiarity with, um, in, in the space with, um, Hey, this is a publication where we actually want to have a lot of D.</p>



<p>People and different diversity of views and they may not stack up or align and it's not planned. It's not to, to do so. It's not meant to, um, push a certain stance, but yeah, inevitably there are some kind of ranges of opinion that a, a publication will kind of get known, known for. Mm-hmm um, I wonder if that's just too new of a thing.</p>



<p>People don't [00:13:00] distinguish between, oh, who wrote this? Who wrote that? Um, yeah, I think that can, that can easily be part of it, but, um,</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> you know, I didn't, you pray up a good point. I didn't, I, I did not. And we have talked about this, but I never really, I didn't, I didn't think about that. You just like enlighten me at that moment.</p>



<p>There are, uh, a lot of publications where it's not as many people. Getting a platform to talk about this many different things. So that could be very confusing to readers and people consuming our media. And that's. Thank you. That's something we need to work on.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Thank you. Yeah. And, and a lot of, a lot of those individual voices have kind of been typecast, maybe unfairly.</p>



<p>I think sometimes even individuals change their views, moderate them, come to new opinions and things. But over time people tend, oh, this podcast, he thinks this way, she, she looks that way. [00:14:00] Um, That might be some of it. And, and also everyone's just guilty going so fast, having so much going by how, how deeply do we read or listen to things?</p>



<p>Yes. And we just kinda box people up quickly. Yes. Um, I, I, I, I think we're in personality. We're probably a bit alike in that, you know, liking a certain amount of. Friction and difference to have some have things to talk about, um, to learn from something that's not familiar or someone who doesn't agree with you.</p>



<p>Oh yeah. Um, yeah. And you guys actually, you know, pay for advertise that you want, you disagree with this. You, we pay you just as much to write for us.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> yeah. Come pay. We'll pay you $300 an article to come disagree with us and yeah. S I'm hearing again, secondhand. So many people have these disagreements and I'm like, why not get, get paid for it?</p>



<p>That's my dream to go disagree with people and get paid for it. Like if [00:15:00] someone had given me this opportunity when I was younger, I probably would be a lawyer because I would be so good at arguing with people. but, uh, yeah, we do because we do, we want to. Opposing views. Like we don't all, and we all don't agree with each other, you know?</p>



<p>Um, I love BTS. Brian does it. Um, Rob has his views on multisite. I'm indifferent to it. , you know, we, but we all get labeled, like, you know, oh, if that's Rob's idea, then it's our idea. And I, I don't completely blame the community for that because that's life. Right. You know, when you think about, well, it's you think about like companies, sometimes companies get, um, mislabeled.</p>



<p>Like, I, I like to use the New York times as an example. Like the New York times is pretty progressive. Most of the time left leaning, in my opinion, that's subjective. And they will run op-eds with conservative point of views and Republicans and things like that. And they get crucified and it's like, everybody forgets that , they're running different opinions all the [00:16:00] time.</p>



<p>So, you know, I, I think that's that's life sometimes too, so I don't take it personally. And, um, right. It's something we can always work on. I'm always open to working on things. Yeah. And that's</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> what you get from a democratized publication space that no, one's able to squash out one particular voice and, and ideally it, they can be in some kind of productive dialogue with each other.</p>



<p>You know, I, I think too listening to if, if you go, if your publication is, and, and a lot of, a lot of the. WordPress space is, is geared towards what's the drama of the day or what's, you know, what's the controversy up here. The, um, I wonder how much of it has to do with like energy levels, cause that stuff can raise energy and levels, expenditure and anxiety.</p>



<p>Um, and, and it also, there's a cognitive load to who is this? Who wrote this? Do I know them? Who are, you know, there's all this, it, it takes real effort to. To make that three dimensional to [00:17:00] make that connect, um, more deeply. And, and I think that's just what happens on the, on the internet, unless you make the effort or, you know, you meet it at word camp or something, something like that.</p>



<p>You don't, you don't have context. And, um, I understand you don't want to deal with, um, a lot of noise some of the time. And, um, since I'm not really running. Opinion or oriented, um, publication and actually going slow and focusing on more business pragmatics, a lot of the time and avoiding drama. That's, that's kind of what our longstanding, um, Attributes that people like that I</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> thinks for the special sauce where's in that Dan where's oh, actually life is meant to be fun.</p>



<p>I [00:18:00] like to have fun. risk. Oh,</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> it's in, it's in there. I think it, I think it just comes SL it comes slower and. When you're able to do more listening and, and cover a lot of things, not just like what is going on in the core project, but, or automatic, but there's a whole ecosystem. There's little fish and big fish.</p>



<p>Um, there's middle, middle sized ones. There's, there's all these different, um, concerns around the. The commons around, uh, WordPress that everyone has in common as they're what they're basing their business on in some way. So I don't know. I don't, I don't, I don't, I think that's fun too. It's a different kind though.</p>



<p>and, and it doesn't, uh, it's, it's definitely, um, definitely a different maintains, a different mood. Um, but. [00:19:00] Yeah. What do do you, do you think that there's a, there's a, a regular current, we need to maintain in this space where there's critical questioning, um, a kind of dialogue going on that, um, that hits maybe some of the bigger, um, Bigger tougher questions.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Nope. I think people should be able to say whatever they want, you know, um, as long as it's not hate speech and no one yells bomb in a crowded theater, that's my opinion on that. Um, no, one's even when. Profess your love of things. People are going to disagree. I think no matter what you write, people are going to dis disagree.</p>



<p>And as you said, post status, you know, y'all, y'all have a pretty neutral stance on things and y'all do a good job of it. And people still disagree with you. So, oh yeah. Um, no, I mean, you know, so it's like, there's no ways to avoid it. I don't think there's a plan for that, but, um, I don't, I don't, I don't [00:20:00] know the, I guess I'm ponding that answer as well.</p>



<p>And that's something I'm thinking about, but until then, I'm not going to, you know, limit anyone. I want them to speak about everything. If we could talk about everything everywhere all at once, I would love that, but being realistic, you know?</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Yeah. I wasn't suggesting it'd be a limit limited in some way, but that, um, just the, the, this, the public, the WordPress public sphere, I say sometimes, you know, kind of the, the debate, um, arena, the public square it's.</p>



<p>It's not always in the greatest shape, especially now you might, might, might exist. um, is there, is there work to be done there where there are unavoidable differences, disagreements, big thorny questions that do need to be maintain? Yeah. There [00:21:00] needs to be some dialogue maintained about those. And is that kind of more, what you're you're tackling.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, honestly, no. Um, but because this is the thing and I, I'm not just, just saying it for you. It's something I had to work with too. We're all. We're all from different places. We have different cultural backgrounds and we have different, even if we have the same cultural background, we have different upbringings.</p>



<p>We're different people. I don't think there's going to be a uniform way to do that with so many different personalities. I'm not saying, you know, if it could be done. Sure. I just don't think it can be done. Um, we're also different. And I think honestly, if we embrace that more people wouldn't be, as you know, what's the word.</p>



<p>it wouldn't come off as, um, antagonistic. Is that a word? Did I make that up? Yeah. Yeah. I think people wouldn't be, be like that, but it's, it's like, okay, this person is this type of way. And we're just gonna write [00:22:00] them off as oh, that's them? No, let's, let's bring 'em in. Let's see why they're that way let's work together in this, this, this community, like a community should, um, if we're a community, a community.</p>



<p>They take, they take care of each other, they're they, you know, even their craziest member. Well, I gotta stop saying that. Um, even their members that we think are eccentric or we think are not like us, we take care of our, we take care of our own. And, um, I don't see that in the WordPress community. I see. Oh, that's just the way they are when that person could be one of the greatest people you've ever made in your life.</p>



<p>If you gave it a chance, um, or they could be horrible, but you know, what are we gonna do? We're gonna try. We're gonna not try. We're gonna give. Are we a community or not?</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, that, that's kind of what I mean, like, do you see yourself as kind of in your mission to, to try to create an inclusive space?</p>



<p>That's not one person or one, you know, organization or just one particular agenda and on any issue, [00:23:00] but, um, open kind of the open stage, um, ally, ally kind of brought that up. What was the mm-hmm the, um, podcast episode she did recently where. She talked, she called it debate club, which to me sounds a little little on the antagonistic side of, and she meant it more on, you know, like back in the olden days when maybe high, high school debate clubs were, were, uh, not, not as, uh, intense as I imagine they might be now.</p>



<p>Um, just a space where, where you can, um, you. You can try out different ideas and it's, you know, it's not to be taken personally like this is, we're gonna try to, what's the best case you can make for this. What's the best way to look at this issue. And, and then how does someone who totally takes it another way?</p>



<p>How do they respond to it? Is that the kind of, would that be like a healthy, healthy thing [00:24:00] that you guys are shooting?</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> we don't have a uniform goal. So that's, that's again, a thing like is master WP. Doesn't have a, a, a one thing we're all trying to do. Um, so I mean, if you're asking me personally, um, I, again, I don't think that's possible because the people are so different and, um, I wanna just spin that on. Like, I'm not saying like, everybody is like so different from me and I just feel overwhelmed.</p>



<p>Like I meet a. Uh, kindred spirits in the community. Um, but it's just like, even when you just said like, you know, debate club was kind of harsh, that was like probably the most, I think, polite thing you can say. I can't think of anything polite or to say and that's not anything wrong with you. That's just something I have to look at.</p>



<p>Like, um, I try to, I'm trying to make my language more accessible. Like not say things like crazy, like it tears me up to say that like, so, you know, that's something, um, I think, you know, I wanna work on, but also like I [00:25:00] don't, I don't know. That's something I've never thought about. That's a that's Ally's idea and, you know, ally works with master WP, but we, we haven't talked about that as a whole, as master WP because master WP lets everybody express themselves and be their own person and have their own ideas.</p>



<p>Um, Not saying no one else does, but yeah. Um, I don't think it's possible me. Naisha saying that now the rest of my team may have different thoughts on that. And actually I think that's really awesome. And I want to talk to Allie about it. I wanna talk to my team about it. So, um, yeah, I'll definitely talk to them about it, but, um, I just don't see it as possible.</p>



<p>I also don't see it as necessary. Um, I don't, I don't, people are always going to yell and Twitter has given people the ability to yell from their homes. Like, you know, it's people who would yell at about stuff and complain and say things. They would never say if they had to say it in public, Twitter has given them that space and right.</p>



<p>We can't really take it away. Um, so I don't know Dan, to answer your question. I don't think it'll work, but I don't, I don't like saying nothing will work. I think everything should at least be [00:26:00] tried. Hmm.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, I think, yeah, the more good models there are, um, the better, yeah, like checking, checking ourselves on the, what seems like crazy far out irrational, extreme opinion.</p>



<p>I mean, that's just, so that's such a common feature of when things get bad in a, in a community, um, inability to talk because. You're, you know, some other perspective is just so far, far out. And, uh, that, that may be the case. Maybe things are, you know, really that broken sometimes. But I would like to think, and I, I don't think they are in, um, something like in an open source community like WordPress.</p>



<p>Um, you just kind of have to give people that, that tolerance. Forbearance is a good word. Um, and step back from, you know, recognizing this, okay. I don't know where they're coming [00:27:00] from. This doesn't make sense. I'm gonna try to find out, I'm gonna try to understand it from their point of view rather than oh yeah.</p>



<p>You know, call it just nuts. Um, yeah, I think that's hard to do when we don't, we don't have a space where that, um, seems to happen. A lot. And it reminds me, it actually reminds me of way back when I did a lot with Jula kind of when they're at their high point and then over it, um, it's a lot, it was a lot similar to WordPress in that, um, They developed a, a third party plugin theme ecosystem is where there are a lot of people making good money and agencies and so on, and who really feel in invested in, in the product and then very, sometimes alienated from where it's going and how decisions get made and so on.</p>



<p>Um, and. That kind of language emerged, like just complete your perspective is so far out from mine clearly. , [00:28:00] it's, it's, um, not worth any time to try to understand. And yeah. Do you see that kind of thing going on? Is that something we can help in, in some way, is that just helped by letting more people. Have the</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> floor, more people need to be elevated in the community.</p>



<p>Yes. Um, I get asked to do a lot of podcasts and things, you know, like what we're doing now. Sometimes I just say no, because I don't think I should be the only voice. I don't think I should be the only one talking for master WP. I don't think I should be the. No, nobody's like done this, but in, uh, outside of nobody's done this in the WordPress community, but outside of the WordPress community, I don't think I should be the black person you go to talk to about, about black issues.</p>



<p>I think, um, Once I, I, you know, I, I have my voice and if I wanna say something and if I wanna talk to people, I can do it. Um, but other than that, I think we should be elevating people. I think if the community was a little bit more diverse, I know I say that all the [00:29:00] time, people would know how to deal with opposing opinions, from different people who may be from different backgrounds.</p>



<p>I see that I see it as diversity issue. I see some of the same people who click together, not agreeing with some of the other people who were the same and click together. And I'm like, if you guys didn't do that, maybe you wouldn't be so upset all the time, but I don't know. What do I know? I'm new. I'm I'm joking.</p>



<p>But, um, I guess would the, would there be a space where everybody could just be, not use bad language or threatening language and it'd be like a little safer space for people. Again, culturally, I, I think that's impossible. Um, because you know, my, you could disagree with me as long as you don't cuss at me or yell at me.</p>



<p>You can disagree with me all day, but that's not with other people. It's like, you can't use certain word and completely understandable. You can't use certain words with me. You do that. That's that's, that's why I tap out. We have to learn that about each other. And if like, if [00:30:00] nobody's willing to learn that, and I mean, on both sides of people who don't want you to use any strong language, don't wanna learn that about other people.</p>



<p>That, you know, strong language is not a big red flag to them. And I think people are misunderstanding each other. They're like, wow, he's, you know, they are just so threatening toward me. And they're like, I thought we were having a regular conversation or maybe on the other side of that, like, you know, I, I just it's people need to talk to each other.</p>



<p>I think it's communication problem. It's a diversity problem. It's communication problem. If we want those spaces to happen, people need to talk to each other. I don't see a lot of people talking to each other in the C. unless they agree with each other and that's bad in any community,</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> right? Yeah. The absence of, of any, any friction there, it's, it's a tough mm-hmm seeming paradox of the absence of, of conflict tends to indicate a problem because people are just individuals and, and different and you, and you need that.</p>



<p>You need questions and [00:31:00] friction to be. To come up with better ideas and to grow, to grow, to see things that you didn't wouldn't otherwise see. And, and if you're repressing all of that, it's gonna blow up some more dysfunctional way. Oh yeah. So yeah, the high conflict personality, I think in. Psychology is, is actually someone who, who just doesn't doesn't have any repertoire of responses to it.</p>



<p>It's a normal part of life and they try to avoid it and try to suppress it. And that actually causes more conflict than they just don't have the tools to, um, to deal with it.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Do you think, uh, maybe I, I have a question. I'm sorry. You said high conflict people. Yeah. Right. Who, what would, uh, be your definition of high conflict people?</p>



<p>And then I'll tell you mine, and then I can tell you, and then we can talk. Um,</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I think, I think the psychological model, um, that I dimly have read about is, um, it, you, it is [00:32:00] just the simple definition would be someone who ends up in conflict a lot. Um, and maybe they don't know why , um, mm-hmm they may not think they are because they're trying to avoid it all the time.</p>



<p>Mm-hmm and. you know, like, um, say like the worst example would be like, you know, estrangement in a family or something like that. Mm-hmm so these two people don't talk mm-hmm at all. That's not a condition of detachment or peace. Uh it's a, it's a cold, it's a simmering thing that will go off as soon as they get together or something triggers it.</p>



<p>So mm-hmm um, Yeah, high conflict tends to come from not being able to manage reasonable levels of conflict in reasonable ways, because that's just what human groups require.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> You don't think like most of what you said is kind of subjective though.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Oh, sure. , it's just a, a model, uh, a hypothesis, I guess,</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> but like, I, I think I could fit into [00:33:00] that because I, like I said, when I told tell people, like I address things, people can take that as like, if.</p>



<p>She'll like yell at you. If you say something to her, I can say, but it's not that I like to talk to people like positive, or it could be positive or negative. You could come to me and say, oh my God, ni I just had the great day ever. And I'm gonna say what happened? Let's talk about it. You could come to me and say, I just had the worst day ever.</p>



<p>I'm like, dude, what happened? Let's talk about it. My responses will not change. Um, but just people who address things because we're in a community, we're in a society. , we're in a place where. People are very nonconfrontational. They are very nonconfrontational in the text space, not even just WordPress.</p>



<p>Right. So I, I could come off as like confrontational or aggressive and I'm not I'm I will, my responses will be the same. I just, yeah. I like, I'm curious. I told you, I'm a naturally curious person. I ask you like 50 million questions a day and you always answer, and I appreciate you. and I, I, that, but that could be taken the wrong way.</p>



<p>So it's [00:34:00] like, I'm not a psychiatry person or psych psychological person. I can't look into all these things to see how we should treat these different people. And that, I just think we should have more opposing or diverse thoughts so we can, you know, get more people who are not just like in a echo chamber together, and then we can grow and make changes from that.</p>



<p>We just, there's no way we're gonna get to a point where everybody's nice to each other because nice is subjective.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Well, yeah, and there's a lot of culture in it too. I, I think what in the way I I'm looking at it, um, the way you describe yourself and, um, I would probably fit in that, in that too, is, is not a high conflict personality, but people might who, because, because you're a pressure valve because you're, you're, you're not gonna bury stuff or, and it's not that big of a deal to you.</p>



<p>Yeah. But the per the person who's trying to avoid. Conflict that every turn is suppressing. What they really think is suppressing, [00:35:00] uh, things that probably matter a lot to them. And you don't even know. And then boom, it comes out at one point that's. Oh yeah. That's a really negative kind of conflict to have.</p>



<p>So if, I don't know, you keep it kind of at a Luke warm level. A lot of the time, it's not, you know, that's pretty good. I'm I'm originally from the, the Northeast and. And there's , there's generally more time, especially in the Metro Northern New Jersey, New York, um, region there it's um, it's, uh, it's probably looked on as, as high conflict personality.</p>



<p>It's aggressive. aggressive. Yeah. Drive. Sure. Learning to drive in, in New Jersey is fun. Um but it's actually, it gives you a lot of, it's a lot of tolerance. It's a lot of space because you can, people can push each other a long way and it's, and they have a lot of options to, um, , there's a lot of moves you can make.</p>



<p>And, and a lot of it is. You know, [00:36:00] it's just, it's just talk it just Jerry Feld, people like to talk um, but then, you know, moving to the Midwest or the south at different times, totally different thing. And people don't interpret, um, you know, the threshold that they have for tolerating. Um, Um, open disagreement or questioning is lower.</p>



<p>Oh. So low differently.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> And , they love me here.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah. I mean, I kind of missed the Southern ways of, of kind of. Backhanded dealing with</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> things. I don't miss this. We see we, we are opposing each other again. I, I love that New Jersey, New York, Boston way of, of being of talking to people because it's, you know me to understand it's it's so it's genuine, like here, like people could be talking to you and hate your gut, so you'd never know oh, bless your heart.</p>



<p>So awesome. Like, [00:37:00] oh God, I hate that. Those are fighting words. So again, like someone might say, bless your heart. Oh, they're they're blessing you. I'm like, no, they wanna fight. I'm just kidding.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I got used to it. I don't know it, but it's, it's a way of everyone knows is they're putting it off to the side. I, I never really figured out the, the Midwest.</p>



<p>Um, doesn't really have anywhere for it to go and that, uh, that's a problem. I don't have a lot of west coast experience. I don't get it at all then. Oh, I love the west.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> You don't like the west coast. We disagreeing again. Dan, we're supposed to be, I don't</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> know. I'm just saying I'm neutral. I mean, I hardly, I've only been there a few times.</p>



<p>I'm kind of probably biased against Southern California car, all that. I probably like the north in the bay area, but we're gonna, we'll actually meet each other. In San Diego so we can, yes, we can check it out.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> that's gonna be fun now that you say that I love the voice closed. The people are so laid back in my opinion.[00:38:00]</p>



<p>They're so laid back.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> that's the reputation. It just, yeah. Is there, is there something else going on underneath? I don't know.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> That is so funny to me.</p>



<p>huh? Insidious Californians.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, yeah, it's a big, well, that's, it's a huge, we generalize like that. So these it's like GDP of a top, one of the largest countries, big population, very first, every respect and yeah, WordPress is, it's like California. It's like, like any big country. It's just, I think the diversity is there.</p>



<p>It's not, yeah, it's in, it's</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> in. I'm</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> sorry. There's there's not, there's a lot of underrepresentation of mm-hmm underrepresented groups. We that's definitely there, but there's huge diversity in the types of personalities and people and what their [00:39:00] experiences are and how they came into WordPress and how their business works and what ships they've got on their shoulder or what words will trigger them off.</p>



<p>And we don't know that, that stuff until you get up pretty, pretty close and. Yeah, I don't, I don't know if there's much we can do, um, podcasts or articles to, uh, smooth that process of, um, connection. I think that's more of an in person thing, your, your meetups that you're starting are probably most important.</p>



<p>The mentoring, you know, gets people together.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. But I mean, if it's me mentoring and you. I have this stigma against me who people really be happy about that. not saying I do. I'm just saying, um, just adding on what you said about diversity. Um, we need more diverse people too. I know we had diversity diverse minds, but if we were as diverse as Iowa am comfortable with every podcast I would get asked on, wouldn't be led by [00:40:00] white men.</p>



<p>There's been one, there's only been one I've been. Or been asked to be beyond that wasn't led by white man, and it was led by alley my homie alley. So it's like, yeah, that's not diverse. That's that's not it at all. Um, diverse minds. Yeah. What do those mind, what are those minds attached to so I I'll, um, I think we need to go a little further with that.</p>



<p>I think, I think we need to go a little further with that, but, um, I lost my thought. I'm sorry. We need to go further. We need to go further.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Definitely. And well, yeah, I think you've affected change in that area. Winston, I think was early voice there and Allie and love her and you and love her. Um, yeah, I mean all people I, I hope to meet, um, and getting, um, kind of beginning to normalize.</p>



<p>What would you call it? Uh, travel [00:41:00] scholarships. Um, and yeah, you know, you wanna have underrepresented people here. Well, let's, let's meet the needs. Let's actually talk about that. I kind of like it's, it's too bad that, um, people are kind of desperate for getting tickets to word, word, camp us. Um, but I kind of like the fact that.</p>



<p>People are talking more openly about, um, about the process, you know, there's the whole what's, when are you going? What, what days? And all of this stuff, that's kind of all out, out in the open rather than just, um, I don't remember seeing that quite so much. It</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> used to be as like a secret, what was it? Tell me about it.</p>



<p>You know, I don't know. No, no, no.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Maybe I just wasn't paying attention. It was not a secret, but, um, I think, I think that. That it's been a couple of things that it it's been so long since the last one, that this is kind of a [00:42:00] reboot plus everything else that's going on in the community. And then 600 5650 tickets, um, that went on the market and got snapped up in 45 minutes.</p>



<p>Um, it's, it's definitely, there's definitely more talk about. About the journey there and the importance and the importance of it. Um, and I don't know, that just seems good. Um, in some ways I, I wish, um, you know, I hope everyone can, well, I wish everyone could make it. Who wants to, I wasn't, I wasn't sure if I would, um, initially, but, um, Yeah.</p>



<p>When people are saying, Hey, I need . Is there a way I can get, um, then, then that's in the, in the community there it's in like an a, it's a basic question of, um, can I get there? Can I be in, I wanna [00:43:00] be included in this, is that possible? Um, I just haven't seen that, that come up before. It's just a very private thing.</p>



<p>Yeah. Oh,</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> well, I think that's. Well</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> it's upside. I mean, it's not awesome that people, people are gonna get shot out. I or it's to something. No.</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, of course not. It's awesome. That. The want is that high, like, oh yeah. Especially to network and meet everybody in the community. Cuz I mean meeting face to face, I think, eh, it is COVID, I'm kind of hesitant on that and what monkey pop now?</p>



<p>Ugh. Oh yeah. But um, I think meeting will actually help people too. I think the internet gives you a lot. Gives not you. A lot of people louder, negative voices than they. Would usually have, yeah. I think a lot of, um, impersonal contact will, that'll be one thing that helps. So that that's an answer to your question earlier.</p>



<p>I think that's gonna help. We're gonna have such a good time at work camp and like, everybody's gonna be like happy and they're gonna love each other and your face. [00:44:00] I, I just wanna see your face, but I think you be like, Hmm, we're gonna, what,</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> but it's gonna be good. You're reminding me of my. Friend and cop neighbor when I lived in, in Milwaukee and he, uh, what, nothing go ahead, get a certain personality type.</p>



<p>And, and he was actually very sensitive and, uh, well, red guy, but, uh, if I mentioned. Anything that sounded like that. He'd say something about like, uh, yeah. And all the animals and people will hold hands and dance around the trees together or something like that was</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> his. And why can't we do that? It's California.</p>



<p>It's Southern California. We can do that.</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, it's always, it's always worth the effort of getting, getting people together and it does happen. It's a very individual thing and I, I hope there is. More of that. I've only gotten it online when, when I take the time to, [00:45:00] you know, take some blows and talk to people, um, listen, don't react and, and try to understand where they're coming from.</p>



<p>And that's just, yeah, it's, it's so much easier in person usually because, um, yeah,</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> just empathy. Oh yeah. We need a lot more. You do you want me to end by like singing some Julie Andrews? I have a really great voice. Oh, wow. I'm joking. I'm joking, Dan. No, you look too excited. Never mind you look so excited by me.</p>



<p>No,</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> there's a, there's a karaoke request from Miriam Schwab. Um, in our, in post dad, slack. Yeah. People are lining up. And then out burger trips</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> and I do love karaoke. Okay. We'll we'll do it in California. We're</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> you are, you are a singer. Is that</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> true? I am not. I lied. No. Okay. I, I have like a people tell me I have a singing voice.</p>



<p>I don't know what that [00:46:00] means. I guess I kind of, I, I like, sometimes my sentences are like long, like a song, like I'll extend out a word that I, I don't know, but I cannot sing. I will sing though, especially at karaoke. So you'll see. All</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> right. I will definitely be watching. avoiding . I have never, never really?</p>



<p>Um, no, I don't think</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I've ever done it. No duet. We can't do it. Duet. Wouldn't do it. Oh, really? damn. Come on. Depends what</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> it is. I'm sure you'll pick something. All</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> right. Something</p>



<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> fabulous. All right. Well, good talking to. You</p>



<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> too see you</p>

<p>Matt Mullenweg had <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2022/08/01/developing-the-redesigned-home-and-download-pages/#comment-9362">commented</a> on the plans for the new designs moving into development, saying that it should have taken &#8220;hours not weeks to implement.&#8221; His most incendiary comments, that fired up a subsequent conversations about the realities of working with the block editor, referenced WordPress&#8217; competitors.</p>



<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a basic layout, it‚Äôs hard to imagine it taking a single person more than a day on Squarespace, Wix, Webflow, or one of the WP page builders,‚Äù Mullenweg said. </p>



<p>Marsland decided to take the challenge using Gutenberg. For this exercise he used WordPress&#8217; most recent default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two. His results are not identical to WordPress&#8217; new designs but are very close, and he was able to whip up the homepage in approximately 20 minutes.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRrrYGpz9Qo">video</a> (embedded below), Marsland walks through the creation of each section of the homepage. He is what one might describe as a power user with the block editor. He can quickly shuffle rows, columns, and groups around, adjusting padding and margins as necessary, and assign each section the corresponding color for the design. At this point, this is not something most average WordPress users could do, which is why the video had such a strong response from viewers. Marsland&#8217;s YouTube channel is centered around helping users <a href="https://www.pootlepress.com/wordpress-gutenberg-block-editor-guide/">master building pages using Gutenberg</a> and stores with WooCommerce.</p>



<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>



<p>&#8220;My conclusion was that it&#8217;s pretty easy to quickly get 95% of the design done, but it&#8217;s the final 5% that always takes the most time in my experience,&#8221; Marsland said. &#8220;My guess is that it was more about internal process that caused the delays, but without being involved its hard to say for sure. I really wanted to show that it wasn&#8217;t a Gutenberg issue with building the design (as Matt Mullenweg mentioned Wix and Squarespace and other WP pagebuilders.)&#8221;</p>



<p>Alex Shiels, an Automattic-sponsored contributor on the project, cited a few items unrelated to the block editor, that caused the delays, including working towards &#8220;reasonable standards for¬†a11y, responsiveness, browser compatibility, SEO, and performance,&#8221; as well as collaborating with contributors across different continents.</p>



<p>In response to Marsland&#8217;s attempt, WordPress developer Patrick Boehner commented on how the little details remain extremely important. &#8220;You can definitely tell what was design driven first vs designed in the editor,&#8221; Boehner <a href="https://twitter.com/pootlepress/status/1559550927731937280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1559550927731937280%7Ctwgr%5Ec3a5e9c1f1cbbf40cff90acba6f4cdf2acfe138a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwptavern.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D137103action%3Dedit">said</a>.</p>



<p>Five years after Gutenberg&#8217;s debut in WordPress, theme developers are still challenged to bring designs to life that were not created with a block-first approach in mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;It remains today fundamentally difficult to impossible to take a traditionally mocked up page design and execute that design using blocks,&#8221; WordPress developer Jon Brown <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-launches-new-homepage-and-download-page-designs#comment-431942">said</a>. &#8220;This is a problem.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure, blocks are fine to &#8216;design a page in the browser&#8217; and accept what you get out of blocks, but blocks continue to lack the flexibility and controls needed to produce a responsive, accessible, pixel perfect layout based on a mock-up.</p>



<p>&#8220;What used to take a day and a dozen lines of php and a dozen lines of css, now takes weeks of building custom blocks because the core blocks can‚Äôt easily be tweaked via hooks and lack the basic controls necessary.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gutenberg contributors are making strides by <a href="https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-13-8-introduces-fluid-typography-support-and-revamped-quote-block">introducing fluid typography</a> and are <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/43241">tracking a host of issues</a> related to improving design tooling consistency. In the meantime, theme developers are enduring the necessary growing pains as the block editor matures to accommodate those hoping to make their designs instantly responsive.</p>



<p>&#8220;I‚Äôve been building a full FSE theme from scratch and was surprised at how much of my design I was able to successfully replicate with the editor, theme.json and minimal-to-no custom CSS,&#8221; veteran theme developer Mike McAlister said. &#8220;Sure, it took a lot of tinkering, but I was impressed nonetheless.</p>



<p>&#8220;However, as Jon mentions, the second you need to adjust something for a smaller screen (or bigger screen if you dare to try mobile-first design in the editor), you hit a wall. It‚Äôs particularly apparent with margin, padding, and block gap, which have no responsive controls yet. You can see this adjusted via CSS in the new theme on .org.&#8221;</p>



<p>Responsiveness is one of the issues Shiels cited in why implementing the designs took more time than simply recreating the design in the block editor.</p>



<p>&#8220;However, there are hints of improvements coming for responsiveness,&#8221; McAlister commented. &#8220;Fluid typography and clamp() certainly have helped get typography in check, but there will always be circumstances where you need even finer control. Every other site builder has solved this, there‚Äôs no reason to think WordPress can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt. (I certainly hope so, as ~50-60% of traffic is coming from mobile devices these days!)</p>



<p>&#8220;One of the best ways to push past these growing pains is to have as much dog-fooding as possible ‚Äî using the editor and FSE to build for as many real-life scenarios as possible to uncover these blindspots.&#8221;</p>



<p>Marsland&#8217;s short exercise shows just how close you can get to recreating WordPress.org&#8217;s design in a short amount of time if you know your way around the block editor. He was successful in proving that the Gutenberg page building UI isn&#8217;t the holdup in reproducing designs created in other applications. Rather, it&#8217;s all the other related checklist items that developers generally have to resolve outside of the editor &#8211; including accessibility, responsiveness, and SEO considerations. The closer Gutenberg can get to reducing extra work related to responsiveness and accessibility, the more approachable it will be for regular users trying to produce the designs they dream up on their own.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 21:34:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p class="has-drop-cap">Cory <a href="https://poststatus.com/rethinking-wordpress-products-pricing-models/">mentioned</a> <strong>Jon Christopher</strong>&#8216;s debut of <strong><a href="https://poststatus.com/shiny-new-thing-organizewp/">OrganizeWP</a></strong> last week, calling attention to its unique and unusual pricing model: no subscriptions, you just buy all releases within one major release and then renew for the next release. The idea is to keep a happy, honest relationship between product development and its users. </p>



<p>Jon's been around the WordPress product entrance-exit block before with <strong>SearchWP</strong>. His thinking about OrganizeWP <a href="https://poststatus.com/jon-christopher-has-a-series-running/">goes back a few years</a> too. (Actually it goes back a decade, with OrganizeWP's predecessor, <a href="https://github.com/jchristopher/hierarchy/">Hierarchy</a>.) He's documented a lot of the planning and iteration on his site, so there's a lot to learn from if you're interested in <a href="https://jonchristopher.us/blog/rethinking-wordpress-product-pricing-models/">a different business model</a> for WordPress products. </p>



<p>Will it work? A lot of people with &#8220;subscription fatigue&#8221; seem to like the idea, what about the challenge of maintaining multiple major versions? That concern drives <a href="https://wptavern.com/organizewp-launches-with-old-school-software-pricing-model#comment-431950">a skeptical take</a> from <strong>Carl Hancock</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-wordpress-admin-experience-still-a-blue-ocean">The WordPress Admin Experience: Still a Blue Ocean</h2>



<p>Looking at Jon's model, I wonder if OrganizeWP might be seen as a leading indicator for a couple of important trends and opportunities in the plugin business. </p>



<p>OrganizeWP is a cool and needed product in an area that hasn't received a lot of love from plugin developers, let alone WordPress core: the wp-admin interface. WordPress core will catch up to the rest of the WordPress user experience on the other side of Gutenberg, but that's a few years away. So it surprises me how few plugin shops and developers have looked for opportunities in backend customization. (Only <strong><a href="https://publishpress.com">PublishPress</a></strong> comes to mind as being really committed in this key area with their plugin suite.)</p>



<p>The WordPress admin experience is something everyone wants to change when they're building sites for a team or larger group of users with unique content types and workflows. There's a large gap in what is available to that potentially high-end niche in the premium plugin marketplace. That's whose needs Jon is aiming to meet ‚Äî freelancers, site builders, agencies. It's a good bet there's opportunity in those spaces, if you can go directly to the people there.</p>



<h2>Selling Outside WordPress.org: Don't Go Alone</h2>



<p>Going directly to your target market touches the last and biggest item of note with OrganizeWP: it's not in the WordPress.org plugin repo. There was probably never any thought of putting it there. No freemium model. And at the same time, <strong>Lesley Sim</strong> has gotten attention for pulling <strong>Newsletter Glue</strong> <em>out</em> of the .org repo. Althought it's not exactly uncommon, the reasons why that choice gets made are worth deeper consideration for what it may say about the business and .org ecosystem today. </p>



<p>Dropping Newsletter Glue's free version was a decision made some time ago, but the reasons behind it are really instructive for anyone starting out on the same path. Speaking to <strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> at the Tavern, Lesley <a href="https://wptavern.com/newsletter-glue-closes-free-plugin-on-wordpress-org">noted</a> the challenges of the freemium model with a basic version in the plugin repo, especially if you don't have prior experience developing a product and marketing strategy for this approach. There's no onboarding for plugins owners where sharing current best practices (or simple checklists) with first time plugin owners helps them enter the WordPress.org marketplace. </p>



<h2>Opportunities for Partnerships</h2>



<p>According to Lesley, the main upside of using WordPress.org for distribution is access to the &#8220;[b]iggest distribution channel in WP.&#8221; It's an &#8220;easy way for reviewers to check out the plugin for free&#8221; without contacting the plugin owner too. And finally the .org repo serves as a &#8220;[s]ource of credibility‚Äù from customer reviews.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </p>



<p>Without alternative centralized marketplaces, going outside .org requires plugin owners to create and maximize their own distribution channels, generate their own sources of social proof and provide an interface for customer support. Then there's the barrier of customer confusion and frustration with having to assemble all the parts of their site themselves. Meanwhile, SaaS and no code alternatives are more visible than ever. WordPress hosting platforms targeting eCommerce niches are making the &#8220;looking for an easy button&#8221; market increasingly competitive. There are mature, established models for building a market outside the .org plugin repo, but that may also be a disadvantage to newcomers entering the space.                                              </p>



<p>To get past all these hurdles, why not work together more intentionally? Partnerships, networks, and community building could be the key to success. If other plugin shops and owners see the value in working together and trying to help their customers reach their goals simply and quickly, they can amplify their marketing and distribution networks together rather than try to do it all alone. (See &#8220;<a href="https://poststatus.com/on-the-web-publishing-tool-race/">On the Web Publishing Tool Race</a>.&#8221;) I'd love to hear from anyone doing this or trying to do it, as a smaller, independent product owner today.</p>



<h2>Challenge: Lack of Market Data </h2>



<p>When a premium plugin leaves or never enters a centralized distribution channel, it goes off the radar. We have less data about it and the overall shape of this part of the plugin ecosystem. Assuming the number of plugins sold outside centralized marketplaces has only grown over time with WordPress, we know less about the ecosystem as time goes on. </p>



<p>The .org repo which can be measured. So can the new and growing WordPress.com marketplace. Large ecosystem plugins like Elementor with their own marketplaces are highly visible. But outside of centralized distribution channels, we don't know what's happening or even have a map of that market with any depth or breadth. That's another disadvantage to product owners in that space. </p>



<p>Are the centralized and decentralized products and markets all growing? At what rate relative to each other? However limited it may be, a key metric like active installs becomes an even bigger unknown when product owners set up shop outside the .org repository. That's data they could benefit from most directly. If that's something you're working on or thinking about deeply, I'd love to chat. </p>

<p>On Thursday, August 18, at 3:00 PM EDT, WP Engine-sponsored developer advocate <a href="https://nickdiego.com/">Nick Diego</a> will be hosting an online workshop titled <a href="https://www.meetup.com/learn-wordpress-online-workshops/events/287686793/">Taking Block Patterns to the Next Level</a>. Diego will be uncovering &#8220;some lesser-known pattern implementations:&#8221;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In addition to a review of how to register patterns in block themes, a new method introduced in WordPress 6.0, you will learn how to create semantic, contextual, and page creation patterns. We will also review multiple real-world examples of this advanced functionality that you can apply to your own projects.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Diego identified the following learning objectives for participants in this workshop:</p>



<ul><li>Learn how to register a pattern in a block theme as well as with the designated registration function.</li><li>Learn what properties are available to patterns during registration.</li><li>Learn what semantic, contextual, and page creation patterns are and how to use them.</li></ul>



<p>This session is aimed at intermediate to advanced builders and will be held via Zoom in English with live Zoom transcription. More than 127 people have already signed up to attend this free workshop.</p>



<p>Later in the week, WP Engine-sponsored developer advocate <a href="https://damonacook.com/">Damon Cook</a> and Automattic-sponsored WordPress educator <a href="https://adventuresinwpland.com/">Sarah Snow</a> will be conducting a workshop for block theme builders titled <a href="https://www.meetup.com/learn-wordpress-online-workshops/events/287744779/">Figma to Block Theme</a>. This follows up a previous session called <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2022/08/10/block-theme-builders-design-with-figma/">Design with Figma</a> where participants learned how to use the WordPress.org Figma community‚Äôs Theme Template file to get started with block theme design. That session is already <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2022/08/10/block-theme-builders-design-with-figma/">available on WordPress.tv</a>.</p>



<p>Theme authors interested in learning how to convert Figma design files into a block theme can catch this event on Friday, Aug 19 at 3:00 PM EDT. Cook and Snow will demonstrate how to set up colors, typography, and more.

The plugin was created to minimize customers abandoning their carts due to checkout complexity. It breaks the checkout experience into steps to make the process feel faster and simpler with a distraction-free design.</p>



<p>Flux Checkout 2.0.0 adds a new &#8220;Modern&#8221; theme  in addition to the plugin&#8217;s previous &#8220;Classic&#8221; theme that offers a more app-like checkout experience. Modern has a more minimalist black and grey design. Check out the <a href="https://demos.iconicwp.com/flux-checkout-for-woocommerce/checkout/#details">live demo</a> to interact with the checkout preloaded with a few products.</p>

<p>&#8220;The default Woo checkout is not optimized at all,&#8221; Iconic founder Jame Kemp said. &#8220;It presents you with the required fields, in a pretty unfriendly and overpowering way. If there are too many fields, the user is less likely to checkout.&#8221; </p>



<p>Comparing the default Woo checkout experience to Flux is a bit jarring, and it&#8217;s easy to see how customers may feel overwhelmed with the default. Fortunately, WooCommerce is extensible. The space could use more varied checkout plugins so store owners have more options to customize the experience.</p>



<img />Default WooCommerce Checkout



<p>&#8220;Flux reduces this friction by splitting the fields into steps and reducing the number of fields required to fill in,&#8221; Kemp said. &#8220;It also integrates an address auto complete to make filling in your address into a single field. We also cache the fields so if you accidentally refresh or navigate away, you don‚Äôt lose your info.&#8221;</p>



<p>Iconic<a href="https://iconicwp.com/blog/iconic-acquires-flux-checkout-woocommerce-checkout-plugin/"> acquired Flux Checkout</a> in 2020, just as the pandemic was kicking off. Its chief competitor is <a href="https://www.checkoutwc.com/">CheckoutWC</a>, which offers a similarly modern design, auto-populated fields, and additional templates at a higher price point. More than 3,900 WooCommerce sites are using CheckoutWC, but Kemp says Flux Checkout &#8220;wins on ease of use and simplified checkout.&#8221; In a few months, the company plans to release FluxPay, which will make it possible to &#8220;buy now&#8221; from product pages and will add other time-saving features for checking out.</p>



<p>Kemp reports Iconic&#8217;s WooCommerce products are active on more than 21,000 sites. The company is part of StellarWP and the Iconic team includes four developers, 2-3 support agents, a content writer, and a designer.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our most popular product is WooThumbs, but Flux, Delivery Slots, <a href="https://orderable.com/">Orderable</a>, Attribute Swatches, and our All Access bundle are the most popular/profitable,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Kemp first launched WooThumbs on CodeCanyon in 2011. The Iconic brand was formed in 2018 as a means to consolidate all of his  WooCommerce offerings and move off of CodeCanyon to become an independent brand.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re fortunate enough to have been in the WooCommerce space for many years and have a well-established customer base and set of products,&#8221; Kemp said. &#8220;Right now, and particularly throughout the pandemic, the Woo space has been booming. We&#8217;ve consistently seen growth as a WooCommerce product company. It is becoming a very competitive space and it&#8217;s important to stay on top of the features you&#8217;re offering. You can quickly fall behind.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 21:43:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>So on the podcast today, we have Marieke Van De Rakt &amp; Taco Verdonschot. And they&#8217;re both from Yoast SEO.</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s quite likely that you&#8217;ve heard of Yoast SEO, but in case you have not, it&#8217;s a very popular WordPress SEO plugin installed over 5 million times. They&#8217;ve been optimizing websites for many years and make significant contributions to the WordPress project, committing to Core, sponsoring events and many other things. I sat down with them both at WordCamp Europe, and we talked about some of the recent changes that have taken place within the company.</p>



<p>Having worked hard to build and maintain their company&#8217;s reputation, they decided that it was time to steer the business in a new direction by selling it to Newfold Digital. We get into the reasons for this acquisition and the subsequent reshuffling of the management of the company. What were the details of that agreement? Why did they join forces with Newfold Digital in particular? And how has the acquisition gone?</p>



<p>We also talk about their long standing commitment to contributing back to the WordPress project. Why have they done this? And what benefits have they seen from this approach? Why do they bring so many of their team to WordCamps?</p>



<p>Although Yost is well-known in the WordPress space they recently brought their product into an entirely new market, Shopify. This has led them to create a SaaS version of their SEO solution and has brought them into contact with a completely new market. How has this move gone? And does it mean they&#8217;re moving away from WordPress?</p>



<p>Typically when we record the podcast there&#8217;s not a lot of background noise, but that&#8217;s not always the case with these WordCamp Europe interviews. We were competing against crowds and the air conditioning. And whilst the podcasts are more than listable. I hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world were at play.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes as well. And so without further delay, I bring you. Marieke Van De Rakt &amp; Taco Verdonschot.</p>



<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Marieke van de Rakt and Taco, go on.</p>



<p>[00:03:48] Taco Verdonschot: Verdonschot.</p>



<p>[00:03:49] Nathan Wrigley: I tried that many, many times in the past. How are you both doing?</p>



<p>[00:03:53] Taco Verdonschot: All good.</p>



<p>[00:03:53] Marieke van de Rakt: Yeah. Great, great, great being back at an in-person event.</p>



<p>[00:03:57] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. What are your thoughts about that. Genuinely, what are your thoughts about being back in in-person events? Because I know the Pavlovian response is, it&#8217;s great to be back. I think that, but is there any bit of you, which is mmm?</p>



<p>[00:04:08] Marieke van de Rakt: I have a hard time recognizing people because it&#8217;s been two years. I see now that everybody has that problem, so it&#8217;s like, I know you I&#8217;ve danced with you. I don&#8217;t know who you are.</p>



<p>[00:04:20] Taco Verdonschot: And especially when people are masked. You just see the eyes and, and if they like gained a lot of weight or became a bit grayer like me. Or lost a lot of weight, there&#8217;s definitely.</p>



<p>[00:04:33] Marieke van de Rakt: It&#8217;s harder.</p>



<p>[00:04:34] Taco Verdonschot: It&#8217;s a change and with a mask on it&#8217;s a lot harder to recognize people. So I&#8217;m really happy with the badges that have the names on both sides. Which means that it will at least always give a clue and not be turned the wrong way like sometimes happens at WordCamps. Yeah.</p>



<p>[00:04:50] Marieke van de Rakt: So I think it&#8217;s good being back, but it&#8217;s also, it&#8217;s different. It&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s been a while seeing people in such a way. We&#8217;ve talked online, but that&#8217;s really different.</p>



<p>[00:05:01] Nathan Wrigley: For me what&#8217;s strange, and I know this is gonna sound ridiculous, is that you are not this big and I&#8217;m making a gesture about six inches high, but also you both have entire bodies. It&#8217;s not just from the sort of waist up. We are on contributor today, so basically very little has happened so far. But what are your expectations of this event? What does Yoast bring when it comes to an event like this? What are you hoping to do? Do you have like a battle plan? Do you just bring the whole team and just see how it goes? I know you&#8217;ve got sponsorships and lots of things like that. So tell us what your agenda is.</p>



<p>[00:05:32] Taco Verdonschot: We&#8217;re sponsoring, as you said, and we brought a nice booth. There will be activities, and of course there will be stroopwafels, loads of them. So make sure that if you&#8217;re here you don&#8217;t miss out.</p>



<p>[00:05:43] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m gonna pause you there because I don&#8217;t know what that is.</p>



<p>[00:05:46] Marieke van de Rakt: You don&#8217;t know what stroopwafels are?</p>



<p>[00:05:49] Nathan Wrigley: No</p>



<p>[00:05:50] Marieke van de Rakt:You can have like a lot of them because we don&#8217;t bring them back anymore. Right?</p>



<p>[00:05:52] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah. So stroopwafels are cookies, are waffles with sort of a caramel in between. And they are delicious. That&#8217;s that just says it.</p>



<p>[00:06:04] Nathan Wrigley: In the brief time that I&#8217;ve been around the auditorium, you win in terms of t-shirt density.</p>



<p>[00:06:11] Marieke van de Rakt: I saw the same thing. I think a lot of companies don&#8217;t give their employees, t-shirts to wear or different ones. We also, because I have a new one actually Taco but it&#8217;s exactly the same color, so it matches.</p>



<p>[00:06:23] Nathan Wrigley: And there&#8217;s nobody with the purple, so it genuinely stands out. But it also means, I think, that you bring a big team. Which also tells me that you&#8217;ve got a big team. 140, something like that? And I was looking earlier today at the stats for contributions in the version 6.0 of WordPress. Automattic, always the big circle and then there&#8217;s companies, which are vying for second, third. And it always seems like Yoast is number two by a long way. Is that a big part of the Yoast system? Do you encourage your team to contribute and all of that?</p>



<p>[00:06:58] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah, so we have a Core team. That&#8217;s four people working full time on WordPress Core. And that&#8217;s a big part. We also host internal contributor days. Well, actually we&#8217;ve opened them up to the community. So everyone can join remotely, or at the office nowadays. One of the reasons why you&#8217;re seeing so many of the purple shirts today is because our entire team is signed up for contributor day, and everyone is contributing to WordPress today. So probably you&#8217;ll see more brands and, and more colors tomorrow, but bringing people to contributor day is definitely a part of who we are.</p>



<p>[00:07:35] Marieke van de Rakt: It&#8217;s what got us started. So we are really invested in making WordPress better, because that&#8217;s just what we&#8217;ve been doing from even before Yoast was a company.</p>



<p>[00:07:44] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s been an exceptional commitment though. It&#8217;s not an ordinary commitment.</p>



<p>[00:07:48] Marieke van de Rakt: I think so, too. So I, I&#8217;m really glad you&#8217;re saying that. We have an exceptional commitment to making that better. And I think more companies should follow that lead because that way we can really make it better together. So we can bitch with each other about what should be better, or we can just sit down and make sure the work gets done.</p>



<p>[00:08:08] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. It&#8217;s been a busy couple of years for Yoast. Obviously there&#8217;s been the pandemic. Presumably you had to figure out what the office looked like or didn&#8217;t look like and what zoom calls you were gonna foist on people and so on and so forth. You mentioned that you&#8217;re back to the office a bit. But apart from all of that, there&#8217;s been quite a lot of personnel change, especially recently. Joost as in Joost, the man not the product, has changed roles. You&#8217;ve changed roles. Taco has got a new role. I saw a photo the other day with several people who&#8217;ve got new roles. Tell us a little bit about that. What brought that about, and then maybe we&#8217;ll get into the acquisition piece.</p>



<p>[00:08:42] Marieke van de Rakt: Yeah. Well, because that was the trigger. I think about a year before we had the acquisition, we started the process. I already knew that I wouldn&#8217;t want to be the CEO of the company anymore. I think that role is really, it&#8217;s a really heavy one, and it&#8217;s also a very public one, and it&#8217;s just been tough. And COVID was tough. So, when we decided to sell, I already knew that I wouldn&#8217;t want to be the CEO of the company anymore, but I still wanted to work there. But go back to a role I had before I was the CEO.</p>



<p>So I think the acquisition got us all into that change process. So the first thing was that I announced that I wasn&#8217;t going to be the CEO. Now, Joost is an advisor. Omar left. Our CTO, well, I just texted him that I really miss him. But I also understand we&#8217;ve been doing this for quite some time.</p>



<p>Joost himself got a bit bored, not with WordPress though, but with SEO, and wants to do other things as well. And is currently experienced a lot of FOMO he said. But he&#8217;ll be here tomorrow. So he&#8217;ll be on Friday. He said to me, oh, you&#8217;re all contributing and I&#8217;m just writing a blog post.</p>



<p>So, yeah, those things changed, and I&#8217;m really excited because we, um, we now have room for new people to grow because you could see Yoast as this big old oak, and that&#8217;s good and that&#8217;s solid. But it also takes away the sun for other trees to grow. So now it&#8217;s the time for at least within Yoast, to have new talent and new leadership.</p>



<p>[00:10:17] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. Okay, so just sticking to the top tier management, just run us through the changes. Who&#8217;s now in? Who&#8217;s got those key top tier jobs?</p>



<p>[00:10:25] Taco Verdonschot: So I think that list should always start with Thijs, our CEO. He took over that role from Marieke, I think last year, October.</p>



<p>[00:10:34] Marieke van de Rakt: Somewhere like that.</p>



<p>[00:10:35] Taco Verdonschot: Around that time, and then as of April this year we had the bigger change, that we introduced a seven people leadership team. So that&#8217;s obviously Marieke as head of strategy. That&#8217;s Chaya as chief operations officer.</p>



<p>[00:10:51] Marieke van de Rakt: She was already also in the old board. She came in COVID time. So this is her first WordCamp. She was with us for quite some time.</p>



<p>[00:10:58] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah, and then there&#8217;s four new names, and that&#8217;s Irene on the R and D side. Inge on the marketing side. Herre for all the technical stuff. And me as a head of relations.</p>



<p>[00:11:12] Marieke van de Rakt: And those four have been working with us for more than five years. All of them. Yeah.</p>



<p>[00:11:16] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah. All of those.</p>



<p>[00:11:17] Nathan Wrigley: So if we rewind the clock about five years, it feels like nobody was being acquired in WordPress. It was all very quiet. And then about four years ago it began. And then two years ago it was really, there was a daily news cycle of somebody&#8217;s been bought in the WordPress space. And then you came in and I must admit I follow the WordPress news pretty closely. I didn&#8217;t see that one coming. Tell us how that came about. How far do we need to go back before the dates that it was announced, when all the negotiations started, and why you mentioned that Yoast himself was getting a bit bored. But for other reasons, I&#8217;m sure as well, why did that process begin? And how long was that process?</p>



<p>[00:11:54] Marieke van de Rakt: So we talked to parties before just because you get a lot of questions. So it&#8217;s not that we never thought about a possible acquisition or funding before. But we&#8217;re totally bootstraped, and I think Christmas 2020, so the first COVID Christmas, that was when Joost and I decided we should sell or get major funding. And the major reason was that COVID got us scared. We were doing great but it was so much work. We sell in dollars, so we make money in dollars, but all of our costs are in euros. And that makes you very vulnerable for the exchange rate of the dollar.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s something you can&#8217;t control. And with a hundred, I don&#8217;t know 125 people on your payroll, the responsibility was weighing heavily on both of us, and that&#8217;s just something that we didn&#8217;t want to do anymore. So then we hired, we hired a banker actually. Someone who helps you to sell your company. And we&#8217;ve talked to a lot of, well, the usual suspects. Then decided eventually to sell to Newfold.</p>



<p>[00:13:03] Nathan Wrigley: So what was it about the offer that they presented, which said, okay, that&#8217;s it, the green light over there. Was there something in particular? Were there any red lines that you presented to them? Right, this cannot happen, if we&#8217;re gonna sell to anybody. Yeah, just that kind of idea. What were the things that gave the green light to them and not to others?</p>



<p>[00:13:19] Marieke van de Rakt: So when we were selling, we thought about three things. We thought about ourselves. What&#8217;s good for us. And then we thought about what&#8217;s good for Yoast the company, and what&#8217;s good for WordPress. So we wouldn&#8217;t sell to a company that would just do things that would be bad for WordPress. And we won&#8217;t sell to a company that would say you have fire half of your staff or something like that. So would be good for our employees. It would be a good fit for WordPress. And I think the offer of Newfold, Newfold wanted to buy us because of our commitments in WordPress.</p>



<p>So they were impressed with our WordPress Core team. They wanted to do more in WordPress and, so them inquiring us was part of their mission to show we love WordPress, which is the best reason to buy us, I think. And I thought their leadership was really diverse. And I&#8217;ve talked to a lot of boards and they&#8217;re mostly male and white and a bit gray, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with people that are male and white and gray. But it&#8217;s nice to see some diversity in that. Well Newfold Digital is led by a woman. I&#8217;m really impressed by her. So that was at least, for me personally, a big reason to choose for them as well.</p>



<p>[00:14:33] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s a name which doesn&#8217;t roll off the tongue. What I mean by that is, you know, everybody&#8217;s heard of Yoast, everybody&#8217;s heard of Automattic, but maybe not so much Newfold Digital. Can you just tell the listeners which bits of Newfold Digital may we have heard of before? Because I know they&#8217;re a company which are behind other companies.</p>



<p>[00:14:48] Marieke van de Rakt: They only exist for like a year and a half now and they&#8217;ve been combined. So the Endurance group, which Blue Host is the biggest brand. And then you have the web dot com side, but that&#8217;s not a WordPress side. And those two companies were combined into Newfold Digital, and they only existed like a half year and then they acquired Yoast. So it&#8217;s a really new brand.</p>



<p>[00:15:09] Nathan Wrigley: In terms of job stability and all of those kind of things, you mentioned that that was an important part. How&#8217;s that going,? Have roles changed? Has the company still got the same focus that it had a year ago? Well, let&#8217;s not say a year, six months ago, or have you noticed any changes and I&#8217;m firing this one at Taco.</p>



<p>[00:15:27] Taco Verdonschot: So yes, there have been changes due to what we just described in, in changing in leadership, but in terms of direction of the company, it&#8217;s not that Newfold comes in and says, Hey, you need to go left or you need to go right. For exactly what Marieke just told, is they bought us for what we do and who we are. That&#8217;s still true today. So they kept their word from that whole process and are still supporting us in being Yoast and offering SEO for everyone.</p>



<p>Have there been changes in the company in the last six months? Yes, we, we are slowly changing. The workforce landscape is changing, and we&#8217;re changing with it. But nothing forced by the acquisition. This would&#8217;ve happened anyway if we weren&#8217;t sold.</p>



<p>[00:16:14] Marieke van de Rakt: Ah, and nobody left after the acquisition for a few months.</p>



<p>[00:16:17] Taco Verdonschot: No.</p>



<p>[00:16:18] Marieke van de Rakt: So that wasn&#8217;t related to that.</p>



<p>[00:16:20] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah.</p>



<p>[00:16:20] Marieke van de Rakt: I think the biggest change was just that the office is opened up again. And so everything&#8217;s different.</p>



<p>[00:16:26] Nathan Wrigley: In terms of how the company can behave, the inflow of money I presume, you mentioned payroll and how concerning that was. Does that kind of thing evaporate a little bit more? Do you need to worry it a little bit less about payroll, because that&#8217;s now worried about somewhere further up the food chain?</p>



<p>[00:16:42] Marieke van de Rakt: For me that&#8217;s changed dramatically. So I used to look at the sales every day. I think Joost would look at it every hour, and see if it&#8217;s all going well and that changed, and that gave us a lot of‚Ä¶ I was talking to Joshua Strebel, who of course also sold and to like, taking a coat off, that&#8217;s what it is. It&#8217;s taking a coat off, and I still feel a huge responsibility of getting that company with new leadership into a stable, good new path, but it&#8217;s different.</p>



<p>[00:17:11] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah. The funny thing is for me, it&#8217;s quite the opposite.</p>



<p>[00:17:14] Marieke van de Rakt: Yes.</p>



<p>[00:17:14] Taco Verdonschot: Because before, Marieke and the rest of the board would take away all those financial concerns from even the highest management level.</p>



<p>[00:17:25] Marieke van de Rakt: That wasn&#8217;t the best idea though.</p>



<p>[00:17:26] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah.</p>



<p>[00:17:26] Marieke van de Rakt: We did that. We never told anybody about our financial stress. We were doing great, but we were experiencing, oh, we have to grow, and‚Ä¶</p>



<p>[00:17:34] Taco Verdonschot: That was really something that was kept away, and now with, my new role, I&#8217;m suddenly seeing all the numbers and seeing what the numbers mean and how they influence decisions that we&#8217;re making in the company and vice versa, how decisions are influencing our, our revenue stream or our cost. And that&#8217;s a whole new world. So, for me, I&#8217;m looking more at numbers and for you, it&#8217;s obviously with less worry than before. Yeah, we, we found common ground now.</p>



<p>[00:18:05] Nathan Wrigley: Two years ago, or whenever it was 2019, if we&#8217;d have had this same interview, we would&#8217;ve been talking about Yoast SEO and nothing more. But now we can talk about Shopify. That&#8217;s a big change. A giant of a platform. Just give us the theory behind why Shopify? Why not, I don&#8217;t know something else like Drupal, or some other thing like Squarespace? Is that product receiving the same care and attention, shall we say as the WordPress side? Do you have any plans to go into other CMSs, maybe SaaS products, like I said, Wix and Squarespace and so on.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t have to release any of that valuable information if you don&#8217;t want to of course. But tell us about the Shopify thing first. Whoever wants to take that.</p>



<p>[00:18:43] Marieke van de Rakt: We have a TYPO3 extension, of course.</p>



<p>[00:18:45] Taco Verdonschot: Yes and Neos as well.</p>



<p>[00:18:47] Marieke van de Rakt: So we, we had some before, but we, as a pact internally would say that we wouldn&#8217;t do any non open source CMSs, but still we are doing Shopify. So we made the decision, partly because we wanted to be less dependent on WordPress, because although we love WordPress, it&#8217;s very scary if you bet all your money on one thing. So it could be a wise business decision to go into Shopify.</p>



<p>They asked us to come. So Shopify wanted to improve their SEO so they worked together with us. They asked us can you build Yoast SEO for Shopify? So that was a big reason, and their core values are pretty aligned with us. So that was the thing. Okay, we&#8217;re going to let go of the open source part because they&#8217;re really for the small businesses.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s either Amazon because that&#8217;s how people sell, but at least on Shopify, you have your own website, your own store, and that&#8217;s really important. So that&#8217;s why I think why we decided Shopify.</p>



<p>[00:19:44] Taco Verdonschot: And I think it&#8217;s the close source system or SaaS that comes closest to the open source mindset, because it really supports the small businesses, and you can get started super easily on Shopify and anyone and everyone can start a shop. And that is different for a lot of other systems.</p>



<p>[00:20:06] Marieke van de Rakt: And it&#8217;s growing like crazy. So it&#8217;s also a really good business opportunity.</p>



<p>[00:20:10] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah I have no insight into how that&#8217;s going. So it is growing.</p>



<p>[00:20:15] Marieke van de Rakt: Yes.</p>



<p>[00:20:16] Nathan Wrigley: Are you growing with it? Is it taking you along for the ride? Basically, has it been a good move?</p>



<p>[00:20:18] Marieke van de Rakt: Well, We&#8217;ve built the thing ourselves, which is a lot of work because Shopify isn&#8217;t WordPress. we&#8217;ve launched it. We had a successful launch, but we&#8217;re not as well known in the Shopify world yet. So we&#8217;re growing gradually and that sounds like bad news, but I love that because that&#8217;s what we want to do.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s so much fun. We&#8217;re celebrating every five star review we get. So we have a dedicated Shopify team and they&#8217;re so excited to get people to like our product, but Shopify just works a little differently and you can&#8217;t paste your WordPress product over it. So we&#8217;re tweaking it and it gets better every day.</p>



<p>[00:20:55] Taco Verdonschot: Every single day. So the good thing about our Shopify app is that it fully is a SaaS which means that were not bound to releases that people then have to install. And if we decide to push something, it&#8217;s live right now. That&#8217;s a very big difference compared to WordPress, where you&#8217;re relying on people to install your updates and to actually keep their site up to date, et cetera. So it&#8217;s a really different way of developing.</p>



<p>[00:21:25] Marieke van de Rakt: Yeah.</p>



<p>[00:21:26] Nathan Wrigley: Marika. You&#8217;ve got a, I was gonna say a talk, but it&#8217;s not. You&#8217;ve got a panel. Just tell us what this panel&#8217;s about.</p>



<p>[00:21:31] Marieke van de Rakt: This panel is about acquisitions and WordPress. I&#8217;m just going to sit there and if they ask me a question then they&#8217;ll answer. I think a lot of people want to know, the ins and outs of what happens and what does this mean for WordPress?</p>



<p>[00:21:43] Nathan Wrigley: SEO in general. What is going on in the future? I&#8217;ve been seeing quite a lot coming out of the Google verse. Awful lot of people talking about things like AI content and whether or not that&#8217;s gonna be squashed. What do we need to be mindful of in the next 12 months in terms of SEO?</p>



<p>[00:21:58] Marieke van de Rakt: I think the main thing Google does is wanting to present the best result to the user. So if you&#8217;re stable in SEO and just create good content, AI or not AI because it just has to be good. And there are really good AI tools out there, but it should be something your reader will want to read.</p>



<p>And not just something you, nobody wants to read. That&#8217;s not serving anyone. That&#8217;s the thing you need to do. But at the same time on the technical side, we are really looking at what Google is doing. So then you need to just install Yoast SEO, because we&#8217;ll make sure to get the latest technical stuff in there. So the way Google crawls and stuff, we&#8217;re really mindful of that. But I think a normal user wouldn&#8217;t be able to adapt that in a website settings.</p>



<p>[00:22:42] Nathan Wrigley: I have this concern that we&#8217;re gonna be creating content with AI, which is then in turn, the sole purpose of that is to be consumed by Google&#8217;s AI. And it&#8217;s like this cyclical effect where‚Ä¶</p>



<p>[00:22:55] Marieke van de Rakt: But then you&#8217;re doing it wrong way because you should always create content for a user. Yeah. And I am a writer. So I am not particularly fan of AI created content, but I have to be honest, sometimes it&#8217;s pretty good. But it should be original content.</p>



<p>So, you should at least insert enough information in your AI that it&#8217;s an original thought, because an artificial intelligence can never come up with something new. It&#8217;s always something that&#8217;s already out there. So make sure you write something that people want to read. That&#8217;s the only advice that I can give you. Maybe Google won&#8217;t be the only search engine out there.</p>



<p>There are all kinds of rumors that Apple is doing stuff and rolling out his own search engine. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s true, but that&#8217;s something that could happen as well. Google doesn&#8217;t have to be the only, Yoast SEO isn&#8217;t the only SEO plugin. Google doesn&#8217;t have to necessarily be the only search engine.</p>



<p>[00:23:50] Nathan Wrigley: Is that what you focus most of your energy though, because presumably if there is an Apple SEO search page, your work then sort of doubles because you&#8217;ve got to try and figure out their algorithm as well as the Google algorithm.</p>



<p>[00:24:02] Marieke van de Rakt: They&#8217;re probably doing the same thing. It&#8217;s the same with Bing and‚Ä¶</p>



<p>[00:24:05] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah, in the end they have the same goal. They want to answer a user&#8217;s question. So in order to do that, you need that good content. If you want to rank first, you need to be the best result. That&#8217;s basically it. Regardless of which search engine you use to find that.</p>



<p>[00:24:23] Marieke van de Rakt: Wouldn&#8217;t it be fun though? I would get excited again with SEO, if there would be a different kind. Maybe a privacy more minded kind, because that would be awesome.</p>



<p>[00:24:32] Nathan Wrigley: Have you heard of a search engine called Kagi? K A G I.</p>



<p>[00:24:36] Marieke van de Rakt: I haven&#8217;t.</p>



<p>[00:24:38] Nathan Wrigley: Do you remember ManageWP? It is created by him. It&#8217;s in beta only at the moment. And it&#8217;s gonna be a paid for search engine and you&#8217;ll pay them a hundred dollars a year, something along those lines, for no tracking. So the gamble is that you pay. It&#8217;s actually really interesting. K A G I.</p>



<p>Yeah. So what are you gonna do over the next couple of days, the pair of you? What are you hoping to get out of this specific event? Who are you gonna go and see? What things are you excited about?</p>



<p>[00:25:03] Taco Verdonschot: So we made a great start yesterday evening. There was a party by Pagely, and it was on a, on a boat, with so many people and a lot of familiar faces that we hadn&#8217;t seen in three years. And that&#8217;s going to continue because over the course of this event, we&#8217;ll see our old friends and meet a lot of new friends.</p>



<p>[00:25:23] Marieke van de Rakt: Interesting conversations with possible partners. It&#8217;s exciting to meet our Bluehost new colleagues and our Yith colleagues who are all part of the Newfold family, so that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m looking forward to as well.</p>



<p>And I am looking forward to talking to actual customers because I use WordCamps to talk to customers and ask them why they like our product and what they dislike. And, well, I haven&#8217;t done that for ages, so only with people in our local community.</p>



<p>[00:25:51] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;ve got a feeling I know what the answer to this question is. In 2023 WordCamp Europe, wherever that may be, will you be back?</p>



<p>[00:25:57] Taco Verdonschot: Yes.</p>



<p>[00:25:58] Marieke van de Rakt: Yes.</p>



<p>[00:25:59] Nathan Wrigley: Taco, Marieke, thanks for talking to me today.</p>
