<p><strong>H</strong>ave you ever heard someone talking about something called SEO? Have you ever wondered what is SEO and how does it work? SEO actually stands for&nbsp;<a href="https://thinkcre8tive.com/what-is-offsite-seo-and-how-do-i-use-it-for-my-business/">search engine optimization</a>&nbsp;and by definition, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/what-is-seo">MOZ</a>, it is “the practice of increasing the quantity and quality of traffic to your website through organic search engine results.”</p>

<p>One of the main things that makes SEO so important is that all of the&nbsp;<a href="https://hubshout.com/?Get-Free-Backlinks-For-Your-Website&amp;AID=1791">traffic you get from SEO</a>&nbsp;is organic. This means that you don’t have to pay a cent in order to gain traffic to your website. There are many websites that gain a very large amount of traffic to their website. It is said that about 51 percent of all website traffic comes from organic searches. If you don’t have your websites optimized correctly, you are losing a majority of all website traffic.</p>

<p>Being on the first page of Google is the goal when it comes to SEO. The whole reason for optimizing your site is, realistically, to get on the first page of Google which is the largest search engine in the world. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-101/seo-statistics/">search engine journal</a>, the average traffic share generated by the sites listed on the first Google search results page is 91.5 percent.</p>

<p>So what is SEO and how does it work? Well you could write a whole book on this (I am sure there are plenty). In short, SEO is the concept of driving organic traffic to your website through search engines such as&nbsp;<a href="http://google.com">Google</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>. It works by using keywords or phrases that will show your link in Google when someone searches your keyword or phrase.</p>

<p>For example, say you have a web page written about learning CSS code. You will obviously want your keyword or phrase to have something to do with learning CSS code. Depending on how optimized your site is, you may want to use a long tail keyword. A long tail keyword is using a keyword that is more specific to get your site on a higher page rank in Google. So instead of using the keyword “learn CSS” where there will be a ton of other huge websites taking all the traffic, you can use “top CSS tricks to learn in under 10 minutes” or something along those lines. This will help you rank on a higher page because you wont have the competition of all the larger websites.</p>
